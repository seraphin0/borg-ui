## 1. Problem

Three separate problems share one root cause.

**Archive browsing is shallow.** The Archives page is a paginated list with
four icon buttons per row. Archive contents open in a modal that runs one
`borg list` per folder click. There is no way to see what changed between two
backups, when a file was last present, or where a deleted file still exists.
Every one of those needs data that Borg UI never stores.

**Derived data is computed ad hoc and invisibly.** After an import, the HTTP
request itself runs `borg info` and `borg list` and silently logs failures.
The same stats refresh is repeated from an hourly scheduler that loops over
every repository sequentially, from the end of every backup, and from the end
of every wipe. None of it is recorded, none of it is visible, and none of it
is coordinated with running backups, so it can collide on the Borg lock.

**Job execution has no convention.** Twelve job tables share the same core
columns (`id`, `repository_id`, `status`, `started_at`, `completed_at`,
`error_message`, `logs`, `log_file_path`, `progress`, `process_pid`,
`created_at`) but each has its own status vocabulary, its own creation site,
and its own `asyncio.create_task` call. `app/api/activity.py` runs nine
queries and merges them in Python to present one list. `maintenance_jobs.py`
is a half-built shared abstraction without a shared table. Nothing owns
"what is running on this repository right now", which is why a lock error
dialog exists in the frontend at all.

There is also no `archives` table. Every archive list anywhere in the app is
a live Borg call, and only the archive count and newest timestamp are stored.

## 2. User outcome

- A user imports a repository and gets control back immediately. A visible
  pipeline shows the repository moving through connect, stats, archives,
  history index, ready. Failures are red cards with a retry, not log lines.
- A user opens a repository and sees, per category, when it was last backed
  up, checked, pruned, compacted, indexed, and mirrored.
- A user opens an archive on its own page. A Changes tab shows what that
  backup added, removed, and modified compared to the previous one, read from
  the database with no Borg call. A Files tab browses the archive with a
  details pane. Clicking a file shows every archive that contains it and lets
  the user restore any version.
- A user searches for a filename and finds it across all archives, including
  files that no longer exist anywhere except in old backups.
- Archives are shown per series as a calendar heatmap. Gaps and size
  anomalies are visible at a glance.
- Activity remains the ledger of what happened. A separate Background work
  tab shows what Borg UI is doing now.
- Backups, checks, prunes, and index work on one repository never contend
  for the Borg lock, because one runner owns the repository lane.

## 3. Scope

- A unified `operations` table and a single in-process runner with
  per-repository lanes, priorities, dependencies, cancellation, and crash
  recovery.
- New persisted tables: `archives`, `archive_changes`.
- New operation kinds: `stats`, `archive_sync`, `history_index`,
  `history_merge`.
- A follow-up convention: every exclusive operation on a repository enqueues
  the derived-data chain for that repository.
- Migration of all existing job kinds onto `operations`, in phases, with the
  Activity API unioning old and new rows until the last phase.
- Retirement of `stats_refresh_scheduler` in favour of a reconcile trigger.
- Frontend: Background work tab, series heatmap, archive route with Changes
  and Files tabs, file history panel, global archive search, Activity
  category and trigger filters, run chains.
- Plan gating: the history layer is a Pro feature, `archive_history`;
  browsing stays Community (section 11).
- Storybook stories, unit tests, and docs updates for all of the above.

## 4. Non-goals

- No full per-archive file index for instant folder browsing. Folder
  listings keep going through Borg and the existing archive contents cache.
  The change table is sufficient for diff, history, search, and anomalies.
- No Miller-column browser. Breadcrumbs plus a details pane. Columns can be
  a later toggle.
- No file preview, treemap, restore cart, or time-travel scrubber. Listed in
  section 16 as follow-ups that become cheap once this ships.
- No distributed queue. The runner is in-process, like the existing
  schedulers started in `app/main.py`.
- No changes to how managed agents transport backups. `AgentJob` remains the
  transport record; it gains a pointer to an operation in the last phase.
- History index for managed-agent repositories is out of scope until the
  agent protocol gains a `diff` command. Such repositories show the history
  stage as `skipped` with a reason.

## 5. Vocabulary

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Operation | One row in `operations`. A unit of work on (usually) one repository. |
| Kind | What the operation does. Dispatch key for the runner. |
| Category | User-facing grouping of kinds. Filter key in Activity. |
| Trigger | Why the operation exists: who or what asked for it. |
| Run | A group of operations sharing `run_id`, created by one trigger. A backup and its follow-ups form one run. |
| Follow-up | An operation with `trigger = followup` and a `depends_on_id`. |
| Lane | The per-repository serial slot for exclusive operations. |
| Exclusive | A kind that takes the Borg repository lock for a meaningful time. |
| Series | Archives from the same source that form one timeline. Borg 2 series name, or an inferred prefix for Borg 1. |

## 6. Data model

All new tables are created by Alembic migrations under
`app/database/alembic/versions/`. Column types follow existing models in
`app/database/models.py`. Timestamps are UTC and use the existing `utc_now`
helper.

### 6.1 `operations`

```python
class Operation(Base):
    __tablename__ = "operations"
    id                   = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    repository_id        = Column(Integer, ForeignKey("repositories.id", ondelete="CASCADE"), nullable=True, index=True)
    kind                 = Column(String, nullable=False, index=True)
    category             = Column(String, nullable=False, index=True)
    status               = Column(String, nullable=False, default="queued", index=True)
    trigger              = Column(String, nullable=False, default="manual")
    priority             = Column(Integer, nullable=False, default=10)
    run_id               = Column(String(36), nullable=False, index=True)
    depends_on_id        = Column(Integer, ForeignKey("operations.id", ondelete="SET NULL"), nullable=True)
    triggered_by_user_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey("users.id", ondelete="SET NULL"), nullable=True)
    scheduled_job_id     = Column(Integer, ForeignKey("scheduled_jobs.id", ondelete="SET NULL"), nullable=True)
    backup_plan_run_id   = Column(Integer, ForeignKey("backup_plan_runs.id", ondelete="SET NULL"), nullable=True)
    execution_mode       = Column(String, nullable=True)      # server | remote_ssh | agent | rclone
    process_pid          = Column(Integer, nullable=True)
    process_start_time   = Column(Float, nullable=True)
    progress_percent     = Column(Float, nullable=True)
    progress_current     = Column(Integer, nullable=True)
    progress_total       = Column(Integer, nullable=True)
    progress_message     = Column(String, nullable=True)
    error_message        = Column(Text, nullable=True)
    skip_reason          = Column(String, nullable=True)
    log_file_path        = Column(String, nullable=True)
    params               = Column(JSON, nullable=True)         # kind-specific input, small
    result               = Column(JSON, nullable=True)         # kind-specific output summary, small
    created_at           = Column(DateTime, default=utc_now, nullable=False, index=True)
    started_at           = Column(DateTime, nullable=True)
    completed_at         = Column(DateTime, nullable=True)
```

Indexes: `(repository_id, status)`, `(status, priority, created_at)`,
`(run_id)`, `(category, created_at)`.

`params` and `result` hold small kind-specific JSON. Anything large or
queried on its own gets an extension table (6.2).

### 6.2 Extension tables

Created only when a kind migrates. One-to-one with `operations.id`.

| Table | Columns moved from | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `operation_backup_details` | `BackupJob` | archive_name, original/compressed/deduplicated size, nfiles, current_file, backup_speed, total_expected_size, estimated_time_remaining, route_strategy, source_ssh_connection_id, remote_process_pid, remote_hostname, retry_* columns, maintenance_status |
| `operation_restore_details` | `RestoreJob` | archive, destination, destination_type, destination_connection_id, temp_extraction_path, destination_hostname, repository_type, restored_size, restore_speed, nfiles, current_file |
| `operation_wipe_details` | `RepositoryWipeJob` | phase, archive_count, archive_fingerprint, archive_manifest_json, dry_run_output, blocking_reason, protected_archives_json, run_compact, requested_by_user_id, confirmed_by_user_id, confirmed_at |
| `operation_rclone_details` | `RcloneSyncJob` | direction, operation, scheduled_for, bytes_transferred, files_transferred, log_text, error_text |

Check, prune, compact, restore check, delete archive, package install, and
the four index kinds need no extension table. Their kind-specific inputs
(`extra_flags`, `max_duration`, `probe_paths`, `full_archive`,
`archive_name`, `package_id`) go in `params`.

### 6.3 Enumerations

Stored as strings, validated in Python. Defined once in
`app/services/operations/vocab.py` and mirrored in
`frontend/src/types/operations.ts`.

**kind**

| kind | category | exclusive | notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `import_connect` | import | no | `borg info` verification. Synchronous in the request, but recorded. |
| `backup` | backup | yes | |
| `restore` | restore | no | Reads only. Borg allows concurrent reads. |
| `restore_check` | restore | no | |
| `check` | maintenance | yes | |
| `prune` | maintenance | yes | |
| `compact` | maintenance | yes | |
| `delete_archive` | maintenance | yes | |
| `wipe` | maintenance | yes | |
| `rclone_sync` | mirror | no | Uses the existing `rclone` lock scope, not the lane. |
| `package_install` | system | no | `repository_id` is null. |
| `stats` | index | no | `borg info`. Uses `bypass_lock_on_list` if set. |
| `archive_sync` | index | no | `borg list` or `repo-list`. |
| `history_index` | index | yes | `borg diff` per pair. Exclusive because it can run for minutes. |
| `history_merge` | index | no | Pure SQL. |

**category:** `import`, `backup`, `restore`, `maintenance`, `index`, `mirror`, `system`.

**status:** `queued`, `running`, `completed`, `completed_with_warnings`,
`failed`, `cancelled`, `skipped`.

A deferral is not a status. An operation the repository admission refuses
(409 `repositoryOperationActive`) goes back to `queued`; the runner keeps
its bookkeeping in `params.deferrals` (attempts so far) and
`params.deferred_until` (epoch seconds before which the tick will not
dispatch it again), see 7.1. Executors cannot return a deferral.

Mapping from existing vocabularies during migration:

| old | new |
| --- | --- |
| `pending` | `queued` |
| `needs_backup` (BackupJob) | `skipped` with `skip_reason = "needs_backup"` |
| `running_prune`, `running_compact` (BackupJob maintenance) | `running` on the child prune or compact operation; backup itself is `completed` |
| `prune_failed`, `compact_failed` | `failed` on the child operation |

**trigger:** `manual`, `schedule`, `plan`, `import`, `followup`, `reconcile`, `retry`.

**priority:** lower runs first. `0` manual and plan, `5` schedule, `10`
followup, `20` reconcile and manual rebuild.

### 6.4 `archives`

```python
class Archive(Base):
    __tablename__ = "archives"
    id                 = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    repository_id      = Column(Integer, ForeignKey("repositories.id", ondelete="CASCADE"), nullable=False, index=True)
    borg_id            = Column(String(64), nullable=False)    # archive id hex
    name               = Column(String, nullable=False)
    series             = Column(String, nullable=False, index=True)
    start              = Column(DateTime, nullable=False, index=True)
    end                = Column(DateTime, nullable=True)
    duration_seconds   = Column(Float, nullable=True)
    nfiles             = Column(Integer, nullable=True)
    original_size      = Column(BigInteger, nullable=True)
    compressed_size    = Column(BigInteger, nullable=True)
    deduplicated_size  = Column(BigInteger, nullable=True)
    hostname           = Column(String, nullable=True)
    username           = Column(String, nullable=True)
    comment            = Column(Text, nullable=True)
    backup_operation_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey("operations.id", ondelete="SET NULL"), nullable=True)
    history_state      = Column(String, nullable=False, default="pending")  # pending | indexed | skipped | failed
    history_indexed_at = Column(DateTime, nullable=True)
    history_rows       = Column(Integer, nullable=True)
    history_truncated  = Column(Boolean, nullable=False, default=False)
    first_seen_at      = Column(DateTime, default=utc_now, nullable=False)
    last_seen_at       = Column(DateTime, default=utc_now, nullable=False)
    __table_args__ = (UniqueConstraint("repository_id", "borg_id"),)
```

`archive_sync` populates `borg_id`, `name`, `series`, `start`, `end`,
`hostname`, `username`, `comment` from the list output, which is cheap for
both Borg versions. Sizes and `nfiles` come from per-archive `borg info`,
which is expensive (see #854). Rule: `archive_sync` fetches info only for
archives it has not seen before, capped at `INDEX_ARCHIVE_INFO_PER_RUN`
(default 20) per run, oldest first. The remaining ones are picked up by the
next reconcile. The existing info-dialog sync
(`sync_archive_stats_from_info`) keeps writing into this table instead of
the repository row.

`repository.archive_count`, `repository.last_backup`, and
`repository.total_size` stay as columns for backward compatibility but are
written by `stats` and `archive_sync` from this table and `borg info`.

### 6.5 `archive_changes`

```python
class ArchiveChange(Base):
    __tablename__ = "archive_changes"
    id            = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    archive_id    = Column(Integer, ForeignKey("archives.id", ondelete="CASCADE"), nullable=False, index=True)
    path          = Column(Text, nullable=False)
    change        = Column(String(8), nullable=False)   # added | removed | modified | summary
    size_before   = Column(BigInteger, nullable=True)
    size_after    = Column(BigInteger, nullable=True)
    mode_changed  = Column(Boolean, nullable=False, default=False)
    owner_changed = Column(Boolean, nullable=False, default=False)
    summary_count = Column(Integer, nullable=True)      # only for change = summary
```

Indexes: `(archive_id, path)`, and `(path)` for history and search. SQLite
gets a plain index on `path`. Search uses `LIKE` on `path` with the filename
segment; a later phase may add FTS5 if measurements justify it.

One row per changed path per archive. `summary` rows collapse a subtree past
the cap (6.7). The first archive in a series stores its full listing as
`added` rows, which is the only time a full `borg list --json-lines` runs.

### 6.6 Series inference

- Borg 2: `series` is the archive `name` from `repo-list`, which Borg 2
  already defines as a series.
- Borg 1: `series` is derived by `infer_series(name, repository)`:
  1. If a backup plan or schedule targets this repository with an archive
     name template, strip the template's timestamp placeholders and use the
     literal prefix.
  2. Else strip a trailing ISO-like timestamp (`-YYYY-MM-DD[T_]HH[:-]MM[:-]SS`
     and common variants) from the name.
  3. Else `"default"`.
- Series is recomputed on every `archive_sync`; a changed series moves the
  archive to the new series and marks it `history_state = pending`.

### 6.7 History index caps and exclusions

- `repository.history_index_excludes` (new JSON column, list of glob
  patterns). Default seeded on repository creation and import:
  `["**/.cache/**", "**/Library/Caches/**", "**/node_modules/**",
  "**/__pycache__/**", "**/.git/objects/**"]`. Editable in repository
  settings.
- `INDEX_HISTORY_MAX_ROWS` setting, default 200000 per archive. When a diff
  exceeds it, remaining changes are grouped by their first three path
  segments into `summary` rows with `summary_count`, and
  `archives.history_truncated = true`.
- Diff output is streamed line by line; rows are inserted in batches of 5000
  inside one transaction per archive so a crash leaves either a fully indexed
  archive or none.

### 6.8 Per-repository index mode

Shipped in phase 10 (section 13). Until then every repository is `full`.

Some repositories should not be indexed: an archive with millions of files
where a single `borg diff` holds the lane for hours, an offsite copy nobody
browses, or a slow remote where even the hourly `borg list` is unwelcome.
The excludes in 6.7 trim what an index records; they do not stop it. Plan
gating (11.2) already produces a repository with no history stages, so "not
indexed" is a state the runner and the frontend understand. This section
makes it a per-repository choice.

- `repository.index_mode` (new column, `String`, not null, default `full`).
  Values:

| Mode | `archive_sync` | `history_merge`, `history_index` | `stats` | Meant for |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `full` | yes | yes (Pro) | yes | The default. |
| `archives` | yes | no | yes | Repositories too large to diff. Keeps the archive list, heatmap, health, and last-backup age current. |
| `off` | no | no | no | Slow or rarely reachable remotes. Nothing derived is refreshed; the archive list, the card's last-run entries, and dashboard age go stale for this repository and say so. |

- `archives` is the recommended way to exclude a large repository. `off` is
  the explicit choice for remotes, and its settings copy says the archive
  list will no longer refresh.
- The mode is applied in one place: `followups.chain_for()` and
  `reconcile.reconcile_kinds()` take the repository (or its mode) alongside
  the plan flag and drop the kinds the table above says no to. The
  reconcile tick skips `off` repositories entirely rather than enqueueing an
  empty run. No operation is created and then skipped, following the
  Community rule in 11.2: a stage that will never run does not exist.
- Manual work is not gated by the mode. `POST /repositories/{id}/rebuild`
  and a manual `archive_sync` run once when asked, so a user can take a
  one-off look at a large repository. The response and the hub row note
  that it will not repeat.
- Changing the mode to `archives` or `off` cancels this repository's
  `queued` index operations (7.7). A `running` history index is left to
  finish or is cancelled cooperatively, the implementer's call in the plan.
  Existing `archives` and `archive_changes` rows are kept. They show as
  stale, never as deleted. Clearing history is a separate, explicit action:
  the existing `rebuild` with `from = history` on a repository in `archives`
  mode deletes the change rows and, since the mode says no history stages,
  enqueues nothing after `archive_sync` and `stats`.
- Changing the mode back to `full` enqueues one reconcile run for the
  repository so it catches up without waiting for the tick.
- Managed-agent repositories accept all three modes. The restriction this
  bullet used to carry (`off` rejected with a 422 "until the agent kinds
  migrate in phase 5") was lifted at phase 10's G1: phases 5 and 9 met that
  condition, so the agent's stats writer no longer runs outside the queue.
  See Appendix B.

Surfaces:

- Repository settings, next to the 6.7 exclude list, which phase 10 also
  exposes since neither is in the UI yet. One `RichSelect` or radio group
  with the three modes and one line of cost under each.
- The Background work hub row shows a muted "Archives only" or "Not indexed"
  state in place of the history segment, or the whole track for `off`. The
  hub summary excludes such repositories from its stale and failed counts,
  so an opted-out repository never reads as a problem.
- The repository status (10.2) omits the history category for `archives`;
  for `off` both of the card's last-run entries read "Background work is
  off for this repository", linking to the setting, since neither is
  refreshed.
- The archive route's Changes tab and the file history panel render a
  `PlanGate`-style panel with the reason and a link to the setting, in the
  slot where the Pro upsell renders for Community. The two are never shown
  together: plan first, then mode.
- `GET /repositories/{id}` and the hub's repository payload carry
  `index_mode`; `PUT /repositories/{id}` accepts it with the validation
  above.

```

### 7.1 Loop

`OperationRunner.start()` is launched from `app/main.py` alongside the other
schedulers. It waits on an `asyncio.Event` that `enqueue()` sets, with a
fallback poll every 5 seconds. Each tick:

1. Load `queued` operations whose `depends_on_id` is null or points at a
   `completed`, `completed_with_warnings`, or `skipped` operation. If the
   dependency is `failed` or `cancelled`, mark the dependant `skipped` with
   `skip_reason = "dependency_failed"` and continue down the chain. A
   skip with `skip_reason = "dependency_failed"` propagates the same skip
   to its dependants, preserving failure and cancellation through the whole
   chain. Other skipped dependencies satisfy their dependants: skipping
   means the stage had
   nothing to do (agent without diff support, plan without history), not
   that it broke, and `stats` must not wait behind a `history_index` it
   does not use (#917).
2. Order by `priority`, then `created_at`. Skip rows whose
   `params.deferred_until` is still in the future.
3. For each candidate, check the lane and the global limits (7.3). Dispatch
   the first that fits, then re-evaluate. Stop when nothing fits.
4. Dispatch means: set `running`, `started_at`, spawn
   `asyncio.create_task(executor(operation))`, keep the task handle in
   memory for cancellation.
5. If the executor is refused by the repository admission (409
   `repositoryOperationActive`: a legacy job or an agent job holds the
   repository in a state the lane check does not see, such as a prune row
   still `pending`), the runner returns the row to `queued` instead of
   failing it, with `params.deferrals` incremented and
   `params.deferred_until` set to now plus a delay that doubles from 5 s
   to 5 min. The runner does not wake itself for a deferral, and the
   not-before time keeps wakes from other completions from burning the
   attempts. After `MAX_DEFERRALS` (20, about 75 minutes) the operation
   fails with "repository still busy". A requeue whose commit fails marks
   the operation `failed` rather than leaving it `running` with no task.

Executors receive an `OperationContext` with the row, a `progress()`
callback that throttles writes to at most one per second and broadcasts an
SSE event, a `log()` sink writing to `log_file_path`, and a
`cancelled()` check.

### 7.2 Lane rules

`lanes.py` answers `can_start(operation) -> bool`:

- If the kind is exclusive, the repository must have no other `running`
  exclusive operation. During migration, "running exclusive" also consults
  the legacy tables (`BackupJob`, `CheckJob`, `PruneJob`, `CompactJob`,
  `RepositoryWipeJob`, `DeleteArchiveJob`) via one helper,
  `legacy_running_exclusive(repository_id)`, which is deleted in phase 9.
- Non-exclusive index kinds may run alongside an exclusive operation only if
  `bypass_lock_on_list` is enabled; otherwise they wait too.
- No two of the non-exclusive index kinds (`archive_sync`, `history_merge`,
  `stats`) run on one repository at the same time, and no `history_index`
  starts next to one of them; the bypass settings do not change that (#1003:
  two chains of one run started their stats side by side, and on an agent's
  repository a listing next to the stats' `rinfo` failed with rc 2 on the
  Borg 1 cache lock). A running `history_index` holds the lane as before.
  An index row left `running` by a task the runner no longer has is
  requeued at the next tick, as at startup (bounded: it fails after three
  requeues), so it holds neither the repository nor a worker.
- `rclone_sync` uses `run_serialized_repository_command(scope="rclone")` as
  it does today and ignores the lane.
- Executors also wrap Borg calls in
  `run_serialized_repository_command(scope="metadata")`. The lane prevents
  scheduling collisions; the lock prevents accidental ones.

### 7.3 Global limits

Existing settings keep their meaning and move behind one function,
`global_slot_available(operation)`:

- `max_concurrent_manual_backups`, `max_concurrent_scheduled_backups`,
  `max_concurrent_scheduled_checks` apply to the corresponding kinds and
  triggers.
- New `index_workers` (default 2) caps concurrently running index kinds
  across all repositories. Exposed on the Background work tab.
- New `background_paused` flag (default false) stops dispatch of `followup`
  and `reconcile` triggers. Manual and scheduled work is never paused by it.

### 7.4 Follow-ups

`followups.chain_for(kind)`:

| after | chain (in order, each depends on the previous) |
| --- | --- |
| `import_connect` | `stats`, `archive_sync`, `history_index` |
| `backup` | `archive_sync`, `history_merge`, `history_index`, `stats` |
| `prune` | `archive_sync`, `history_merge`, `stats` |
| `delete_archive` | `archive_sync`, `history_merge`, `stats` |
| `compact` | `stats` |
| `check` | none |
| `wipe` | `archive_sync`, `history_merge`, `stats` |
| `restore`, `restore_check`, `rclone_sync`, `package_install` | none |

Follow-ups are created by the runner when the parent reaches a terminal
success state, with the parent's `run_id`, `trigger = followup`,
`priority = 10`. They are not created when the parent fails. Until phase 8
moves backups into the runner, the legacy backup completion paths call
`followups.enqueue_backup_followups` themselves (#933), which enqueues the
`backup` chain unless an `archive_sync` is queued with no dependency or an
already satisfied dependency. Other queued index stages and running listings
do not suppress it. `history_merge` immediately follows the listing on every
plan to delete removed archive rows. `archive_sync` then derives `archive_count` and `last_backup` from the
listing instead of the completion path writing them.

`archive_sync` runs before `history_merge` so the merge knows which archives
disappeared. `history_index` skips pairs whose predecessor is not yet
indexed and leaves them `pending`; the next run picks them up.

From phase 10, `chain_for()` also drops the kinds the repository's
`index_mode` says no to (6.8), the same way it drops plan gated kinds.

### 7.5 Reconcile

Replaces `stats_refresh_scheduler`. Same setting
(`stats_refresh_interval_minutes`, `0` disables). On each tick, for every
repository without a queued or running index operation, enqueue one run:
`archive_sync`, `history_merge`, `history_index`, `stats`, with
`trigger = reconcile`, `priority = 20`. This catches archives created or
pruned outside Borg UI.

From phase 10, repositories with `index_mode = off` are skipped on the
tick, and `archives` repositories get a run without the history kinds (6.8).

### 7.6 Crash recovery

On startup, before the runner starts:

- `running` operations of exclusive Borg kinds: if `process_pid` is alive
  with the recorded `process_start_time`, leave them and let the executor
  reattach where supported (check, compact, as today); otherwise mark
  `failed` with `error_message = "interrupted by restart"`. Local
  repositories get the existing lock-break attempt; remote ones do not, as
  documented in `job-system.md`.
- `running` index operations: use the same recovery budget as the runtime
  sweep of abandoned tasks. Each retry increments `params.requeues`; an
  operation is requeued at most three times, with backoff based on the larger
  of the requeue and admission-deferral counts. A further interruption marks the
  operation failed while retaining its start time and progress. Restarting
  cannot bypass this retry budget; executor checkpoints remain in params.
- `queued` operations are left alone.

This replaces the per-table startup cleanup for each kind as it migrates.

### 7.7 Cancellation

`POST /api/operations/{id}/cancel` sets `cancelled` on a `queued` row
directly. For a `running` row it sets a cancel flag the executor observes
via `ctx.cancelled()`; Borg executors also terminate the child process, as
the existing cancel paths do. Dependants become `skipped`. A cancel that
arrives while the admission is refusing the operation wins over the
deferral (7.1 step 5): the row ends `cancelled` instead of being requeued.

If the terminal database write fails, the runner retains an accepted cancel
request. The runtime sweep completes that cancellation after the database
recovers, without restarting the index executor or dispatching its dependants.
It clears the request only after committing the terminal state.

### 7.8 Retention

`job_history_retention.py` gains `operations` and the extension tables in
its table list. Rows follow `cleanup_retention_days`; log files follow
`log_retention_days`. `archives` and `archive_changes` are not job history
and are never purged by it.

## 8. Index executors

### 8.1 `stats`

Runs `borg info` via `BorgRouter`. Writes `repository.total_size` and
`result = {"unique_csize": n}`. Uses the stats env with `bypass_lock_on_list`
as today. Replaces the size half of `update_repository_stats`.

### 8.2 `archive_sync`

1. `BorgRouter.list_archives()`.
2. Upsert rows into `archives` by `(repository_id, borg_id)`. Update
   `last_seen_at`. Compute `series`.
3. Rows in `archives` not present in the list are collected as
   `result["removed_archive_ids"]` and left in place. The result also carries
   `removed_archive_borg_ids`, mapping each row ID (as a JSON object key) to
   its Borg ID, captured while the listing owns the metadata lane.
   `history_merge` consumes and deletes matching rows.
4. For up to `INDEX_ARCHIVE_INFO_PER_RUN` archives, oldest first, run
   per-archive `borg info` and fill sizes, `end`, and duration: archives
   without stats first, archives missing only `end` into the slots left
   over. Agent repositories go through the agent's `repository.archive_info`
   job; a job the agent does not answer within the info timeout is
   cancelled and the run stops asking. A Borg 1 agent listing needs the
   agent's reported zone to place its naive times; without one the stage
   fails and the next reconcile retries. The listing never carries `end`,
   so a resync leaves a filled `end` alone.
5. Write `repository.archive_count` and `repository.last_backup`.

### 8.3 `history_index`

For each series in the repository, ordered by `start`:

- For each archive with `history_state = pending`:
  - If it has no predecessor in the series, run
    `borg list --json-lines` (Borg 1) or `borg -r R list --json-lines aid:X`
    (Borg 2) and store `added` rows.
  - Else if the predecessor is `indexed`, run
    `borg diff R::prev R::cur --json-lines` (Borg 1) or
    `borg -r R diff aid:prev aid:cur --json-lines` (Borg 2), apply excludes,
    store rows, apply the cap.
  - Else leave `pending`.
- Progress: `progress_current` is the pair index, `progress_total` the
  pending count, `progress_message` is `"<prev> → <cur>"`.
- Managed-agent repositories: set `history_state = skipped` on all pending
  archives and `skip_reason = "agent_diff_unsupported"` on the operation.

New wrapper methods: `Borg.diff_archives(...)` in `app/core/borg.py`,
`Borg2.diff_archives(...)` in `app/core/borg2.py`,
`BorgRouter.diff_archives(...)`. Both parse `--json-lines` output into a
normalised `ChangeRecord(path, change, size_before, size_after,
mode_changed, owner_changed)`. Fixtures come from real Borg output captured
with the `borg-live-debug` skill.

### 8.4 `history_merge`

Input: archives that `archive_sync` reported removed. A target must match
both its row ID and Borg ID in the listing result, within the same repository.
Another chain can delete the original and SQLite can reuse its row ID before
this merge starts or retries. Missing or mismatching identities are skipped.
Legacy results containing only row IDs are also skipped: the next listing
rediscovers remaining stale rows and supplies their identities for cleanup.

For each matching removed archive `R`, find its successor `S` in the same
series by `start`.

If `S` exists, fold `R`'s rows into `S`:

| R | S has | result on S |
| --- | --- | --- |
| added | nothing | copy R row |
| added | modified | `added`, `size_before = null` |
| added | removed | delete S row (file never existed in a surviving archive) |
| modified | nothing | copy R row |
| modified | modified | `size_before = R.size_before` |
| modified | removed | `size_before = R.size_before` |
| removed | nothing | copy R row |
| removed | added | `modified`, `size_before = R.size_before`, `size_after = S.size_after` |
| summary | any | keep S, add `summary_count` |

If `S` does not exist (the newest archive was removed), `R`'s rows are
simply deleted.

Then delete the `archives` row for `R`, which cascades to its remaining
rows. All of this is SQL inside one transaction per removed archive,
including a completion checkpoint in the operation's params. Replay preserves
completed outcome counts and never revisits checkpointed targets, including
skipped targets. This stage makes no Borg call and uses the repository's
metadata lane. Removal targets must match the repository, database ID,
Borg ID, persisted row-generation UUID, and last-seen observation captured
by the parent listing. Each
sighting advances the observation timestamp even if the wall clock does
not advance, protecting archives rediscovered before a delayed merge.
The row-generation UUID remains independent of SQLite ID reuse and wall time,
so deleting and recreating the same Borg archive cannot revive an old target.
The next listing initializes migrated rows whose generation is NULL, including
absent rows. Legacy results missing any required identity skip deletion until
a fresh listing can report the missing rows safely.

The visible effect is honest: a change that happened in a pruned archive now
shows at the next surviving archive, which is the earliest place the user can
restore that version from.

## 9. API

All routes under `/api`. Authorization uses the existing
`require_repository_access_by_path` and role helpers: `viewer` for reads,
`operator` for cancel and rebuild, `admin` for pause and worker limits.

### 9.1 Operations

| Method | Route | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/operations` | List. Filters: `repository_id`, `category[]`, `kind[]`, `status[]`, `trigger[]`, `run_id`, `since`, `limit`, `cursor`. Returns `OperationItem[]` plus `next_cursor`. |
| GET | `/operations/{id}` | One row with extension details and the rest of its run. |
| GET | `/operations/queue` | Live view: all `queued` and `running` rows, plus rows completed in the last 60 seconds, grouped by repository, with lane state and global limits. |
| POST | `/operations/{id}/cancel` | See 7.7. |
| POST | `/operations/pause` and `/operations/resume` | Toggle `background_paused`. |
| PUT | `/operations/limits` | `{"index_workers": n}`. |
| GET | `/operations/{id}/logs` and `/logs/download` | Same contract as `/activity/{job_type}/{job_id}/logs`. |

`OperationItem` is a superset of today's `ActivityItem` so the frontend
table can render either. New fields: `kind`, `category`, `trigger`,
`priority`, `run_id`, `depends_on_id`, `progress_current`, `progress_total`,
`progress_message`, `skip_reason`, `followups: OperationItem[]` (only in
list responses when `collapse_runs=true`).

### 9.2 Repository derived data

| Method | Route | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| POST | `/repositories/{id}/rebuild` | Body `{"from": "stats" \| "archives" \| "history"}`. Invalidates that stage and later ones, enqueues a manual run at priority 20. `history` sets all archives `pending` and deletes their change rows. |
| GET | `/repositories/{id}/status` | Repository status per category from repository evidence: one cell per applicable category with status, `completed_at`, `age_seconds`, `threshold_days`, `overdue`, `running` and `source`; evidence precedence and overdue rules in section 10.2. Not polled: the card reads `last_prune` and `last_index` from the repositories list payload, computed once per page from the same evidence. |
| GET | `/repositories/{id}/archives` | From `archives`. Query: `series`, `since`, `until`. Includes `sync_state` (`fresh`, `syncing`, `stale`, `never`). |
| GET | `/repositories/{id}/archives/heatmap` | Per series, per day: count, total deduplicated size, anomaly flags. |
| GET | `/repositories/{id}/archives/{archive_id}` | One archive with history state. |
| GET | `/repositories/{id}/archives/{archive_id}/changes` | Query: `compare_to` (archive id, default predecessor), `path_prefix`, `change[]`, `limit`, `cursor`. Folds intermediate deltas when `compare_to` is not the predecessor. |
| GET | `/repositories/{id}/history` | Query: `path`. Returns every archive that touched the path with change and sizes, plus computed "present" ranges. |
| GET | `/repositories/{id}/search` | Query: `q`, `limit`. Filename search over `archive_changes.path`, grouped by path with first seen, last seen, archive count, and whether it is present in the newest archive. |

The existing `/archives/list` route remains for one release and gains a
deprecation header; the Archives page switches to the DB route in phase 4.

### 9.3 Activity

`GET /activity/recent` gains `category[]` and `trigger[]` filters and
`collapse_runs` (default true). During migration it unions legacy tables with
`operations`. Index-category rows are excluded unless `category` includes
`index`. Follow-ups are nested under their parent when `collapse_runs` is
true.

### 9.4 Events

`event_manager.broadcast_event` gains two event types:

- `operation.updated` with the full `OperationItem` on every status change.
- `operation.progress` with `{id, progress_percent, progress_current,
  progress_total, progress_message}` throttled to once per second per
  operation.

The Background work tab, the Archives page, and the Repositories page (one
debounced list refetch per burst of finished index or prune operations,
10.2) subscribe through the existing SSE hook.

### 9.5 Anomaly rules

Computed in `app/services/operations/anomalies.py`, returned by the heatmap
route. Pure functions with unit tests.

- `missed_run`: a day inside a series' expected cadence with no archive.
  Cadence is the schedule or plan cron when known, else the median gap of
  the last 14 archives.
- `size_outlier`: `deduplicated_size` or `nfiles` below 60 percent of the
  median of the previous 7 archives in the series.
- `duration_outlier`: `duration_seconds` above 250 percent of the median of
  the previous 7.
- `overdue_<category>`: last terminal operation in a category older than
  the category's threshold. Defaults: backup 2 days, check 30 days, prune
  14 days, compact 30 days, index 2 days, mirror 1 day. The repository
  status does not apply them as such: section 10.2 judges each cell
  against what the repository can expect (series cadence for backup, the
  check schedule, the plans that run prune or compact) and falls back to
  the fixed defaults only where noted there.

## 10. Frontend

All new components ship a Storybook story. Dialogs use `ResponsiveDialog`.
Selects that need rich rows use `RichSelect`. No left accent borders. Every
string goes through `react-i18next` with keys added to
`frontend/src/locales/*.json`. Types live in
`frontend/src/types/operations.ts` and `frontend/src/types/archives.ts`.

### 10.1 Background work tab

Route `/settings/background-work`, tab id `background-work`, admin and
operator visible, wired in `frontend/src/pages/Settings.tsx` and the
settings nav. `docs/navigation.md` is updated in the same change.

```

Components under `frontend/src/components/background-work/`:

- `PipelineBoard` renders stage columns from `/operations/queue`.
- `PipelineStageColumn` with count and worker control.
- `PipelineRepositoryCard` with status, elapsed time, progress bar, retry.
  Moves between columns with a short slide transition when its stage
  changes.
- `ForegroundLaneRow` shows a running exclusive foreground operation holding
  the lane, with a link to Activity and no controls.
- `RepositoryTrackDialog` (`ResponsiveDialog`) shows one repository's run
  as a vertical track with per-stage timing and a "Rebuild from" `RichSelect`.
- `RebuildMenu` for the header action.

Empty state: an `EmptyStateCard` saying nothing is running, with the last
reconcile time.

### 10.2 Repository status

One status model per repository, `app/services/operations/repository_status.py`,
served by `GET /repositories/{id}/status`: one cell per applicable
category (no Mirror cell without rclone storage) with status,
`completed_at`, `age_seconds`, `threshold_days`, `running`, `source`, and
an `overdue` value that is null where the repository expects nothing.

On the repository card the model shows as two entries in the metadata
row, after `Last compact`, in the same format:

```
Encryption: repokey   Compression: lz4   Last Compact: 6 Sep 2026
Last Prune: 4 Sep 2026   Last Index: 7 Sep 2026
```

Backup and Check are key stats already; Mirror is the rclone badge. The
two entries come with the repositories list payload (`last_prune`,
`last_index`), computed once per page by `last_runs` from the evidence
below, with successful runs only (a failed attempt moves neither value,
as it moves neither `last_check` nor `last_compact`; the status route
reports it). The list is refetched from the shared SSE stream when an
index or prune operation completes, debounced with a maximum wait, so
nothing on the card polls. Phase 3 had shipped this as a status strip, a second row of six
cells fed by a per-card route polled every 30 s (roughly 15 to 18 queries
per repository per refresh); it was withdrawn in favour of the row entries
(#937, Appendix B).

Evidence per cell (#935): backup is the newest archive in the archives table,
whatever created it (rows the newest listing reported removed and
`history_merge` has not deleted yet are excluded, as for `last_backup`);
a failed or cancelled Borg UI attempt newer than that archive shows as
that attempt; with no archives the newest job row stands. Prune is the
newest successful `archive_sync` that reported removed archives (a
cancelled sync gets no follow-ups, so its removals are not applied and
the next successful listing reports them again), unless a prune run
through Borg UI is newer. A `delete_archive` or wipe that Borg UI ran
explains the first listing after it, so that listing is not prune
evidence and the next older unexplained listing stands (a prune outside
Borg UI in a deletion's own interval is the one case missed). A prune
dry run is not prune evidence either. The listings are found by a
SQL-side test on the result's `removed_archive_ids` length, spelled per
dialect, never by decoding results in Python. Check and compact have no repository evidence and
keep their job rows. Overdue: backup per series, each against twice its
own cadence (median gap of the series' last 14 archives, the fixed 2 days
with fewer than two); the repository is overdue as soon as one series is,
and the reported threshold is the strictest one. Timestamps of different
series are never mixed into one cadence. Check when the repository's check
schedule is enabled or a scheduled plan runs a check after its backups;
prune and compact only when a plan or scheduled job runs them. A plan
counts only when it is enabled, scheduled (not manual-only), dispatchable
(availability mode or a cron expression; the scheduler yields no due time
for a cron plan without one) and its association with the repository is
enabled; a legacy scheduled job counts by the same dispatch rule and the
scheduler's own target precedence (association rows, else the direct
repository, else the repository path). Otherwise `overdue` is
null. The `source` field is kept for precedence and debugging, the UI does
not label it.

### 10.3 Archives page

- `RepositorySelectorCard` stays.
- `ArchiveSeriesHeatmap` replaces the top of the list: one block per
  series, weeks as rows, days as columns, cells coloured by count and
  outlined for anomalies, hover shows size and duration, click opens the
  archive route. A "List" toggle keeps the existing `ArchivesList` for
  people who prefer it; the preference persists in `localStorage` like the
  existing list settings.
- A `sync_state` chip near the selector: "Synced 2 min ago", "Syncing",
  or "Not indexed yet" with a rebuild link.
- The list and heatmap read from `/repositories/{id}/archives`.
- `ArchiveSearchField` above the heatmap, hitting
  `/repositories/{id}/search`, results in a `ResponsiveDialog` list with
  "present in latest" and "last seen" columns.

### 10.4 Archive route

`/archives/:repositoryId/:archiveId` rendered by
`frontend/src/pages/ArchiveDetail.tsx`. Header: name, series, start, duration,
sizes, `[Restore] [Mount] [Delete]` using the existing dialogs. Tabs:

`ArchiveChangesTab` with a `RichSelect` compare picker, change-type filter

`skipped` it shows an explanatory empty state with a rebuild link.

**Files**

`ArchiveFilesTab` wraps the existing `ArchivePathSelector` browsing on the
left and a new `ArchiveFileDetailsPane` on the right: metadata, `[Restore]`,
`[Download]`, and a `FileHistoryPanel`. On screens narrower than the `md`
breakpoint the details pane becomes a `ResponsiveDialog` bottom sheet.

`FileHistoryPanel` reads `/repositories/{id}/history?path=`. "Restore this"
opens the existing `RestoreWizard` preselected to that archive and path.

**Info** reuses `RepositoryInfo` style metadata for the archive.

`ArchiveContentsDialog` remains for one release as the entry point from the
list view and gains an "Open full page" action.

### 10.5 Activity

- `ActivityFilters` gains category chips and a trigger select. Category
  chips use `CategoryToken`.
- `BackupJobsTable` rows for a parent operation render a `RunChainRow`
  beneath: follow-up kinds with status ticks and progress, expandable.
- Index-category rows appear only when the Index chip is on.
- No action buttons for index work in Activity.

**Per-repository operations view.** `RepositoryCard` gains an "Operations"
action that opens Activity with the repository filter pinned and the URL
carrying `?repository_id=`. It is the same table, not a new component. Runs
render as chains:

```

Category chips filter parent operations only. Follow-ups always ride with
their parent, so filtering by Backup still shows the index work that backup
caused. A nightly plan across ten repositories is ten rows in global
Activity, not forty.

**Boundary between Activity and Background work.** Activity answers "what
did Borg UI do". Background work answers "what is Borg UI doing". Activity
is read-only history with logs. Background work holds every control: pause,
worker limits, rebuild, retry. A running foreground operation appears in
both: as a row in Activity and as the lane holder on the board. Finished
operations leave the board after a 60 second hold and remain in Activity.

### 10.6 Keyboard

In the Files tab: arrow keys move selection, Enter opens a folder,
Backspace goes up, `/` focuses search, `r` opens restore for the selection.

## 11. Plan gating

Archive browsing stays a Community feature. The history layer is Pro. The
split is one feature key, `archive_history`, added to both registries:
`app/core/features.py` `FEATURES` and `frontend/src/core/features.ts`
`FEATURES`, with value `pro`. `docs/plan-content.json` gains a Pro entry
`archive_history` with localized label and description; the existing
Community entry `archive_browsing` is unchanged.

### 11.1 What each plan gets

| Capability | Community | Pro |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Operations table, runner, lanes, follow-ups, Background work tab | yes | yes |
| `archives` table, `stats`, `archive_sync`, DB-backed archive list | yes | yes |
| Series heatmap with counts and sizes | yes | yes |
| Missed-run flag on the heatmap | yes | yes |
| Archive route with Files tab, details pane, keyboard navigation | yes | yes |
| Repository status route and the card's last-run entries | yes | yes |
| Size and duration outlier flags, overdue values on the repository status | no | yes |
| `history_index` and `history_merge` stages, `archive_changes` rows | no | yes |
| Changes tab, compare picker | no | yes |
| File history panel and "Restore this" per version | no | yes |
| Global archive search including deleted files | no | yes |
| Rebuild from `history` | no | yes |

The rule of thumb: anything that reads `archive_changes` or computes an
insight from more than one archive is Pro. Anything that shows what Borg
already knows about one archive is Community.

### 11.2 Backend enforcement

- Routes `/repositories/{id}/archives/{archive_id}/changes`,
  `/repositories/{id}/history`, `/repositories/{id}/search`, and
  `POST /repositories/{id}/rebuild` with `from = history` use
  `Depends(require_feature("archive_history"))`, which returns the same
  403 payload other gated routes use.
- The heatmap route always returns counts, sizes, and `missed_run`; it
  includes outlier flags only when the plan includes the feature. The
  repository status route does the same for its `overdue` values.
- `followups.chain_for()` omits `history_index` and `history_merge` when
  `plan_includes(get_current_plan(db), Plan.PRO)` is false. Reconcile does
  the same. No operation is created and then skipped; the stage simply does
  not exist for Community, so the Background work board shows four columns
  instead of five. Phase 10 reuses this rule for the per-repository
  `index_mode` (6.8): plan and mode are two filters on the same chain.
- When a Pro licence is activated, the licensing service's activation path
  enqueues a reconcile run for every repository so history builds in the
  background. When a licence lapses, existing `archive_changes` rows are
  kept but unreadable through the gated routes; the next reconcile after
  re-activation resumes from `history_state = pending` archives.
- `archives.history_state` for Community installs stays `pending`, which
  the frontend reads as "not available on this plan" when the feature is
  locked, and as "not indexed yet" when it is unlocked.

### 11.3 Frontend enforcement

All gates use the shared `PlanGate` with `feature="archive_history"` and the
analytics `surface` and `operation` props, so blocked interactions are
tracked like other Pro features.

- Changes tab: `PlanGate` with `preview` set to a static, inert sample
  `ArchiveChangesTab` rendered from fixture data, so a Community user sees
  what the tab looks like behind the upgrade prompt. `surface="archive_detail"`,
  `operation="view_changes"`.
- File history panel: `PlanGate` with `disabled` so the panel's header row
  shows with a lock and the upgrade message, without a large prompt inside
  the details pane. `surface="archive_files"`, `operation="view_history"`.
- Search field on the Archives page: `PlanGate` with `disabled`, tooltip
  from the gate message. `surface="archives"`, `operation="search"`.
- Heatmap outlier flags: not gated in the UI; the API omits them
  and the legend shows a small "Pro" chip next to the outlier entries using
  `PLAN_LABEL` and `PLAN_COLOR`.
- Rebuild menu: the `history` option is rendered through `PlanGate` with
  `disabled`.
- Background work board: renders the columns the API reports; no gate
  needed.

Storybook stories for each gated surface show both the locked and unlocked
state, following `PlanGate.stories.tsx`.

### 11.4 Tests

- `tests/unit/test_core_features.py`: `archive_history` is Pro on the
  backend; the frontend features test asserts the same key and plan.
- `test_operations_followups.py`: chain with and without the feature.
- Route tests: 403 for Community on each gated route, 200 for Pro.
- Heatmap and repository status tests: `missed_run` on every plan, outlier
  and overdue flags only for Pro.
- Vitest for each `PlanGate` usage: locked renders the prompt or disabled
  state, unlocked renders the feature.

## 12. Testing

Backend, `tests/unit/`:

- `test_operations_vocab.py`: every kind has a category and an exclusivity
  entry; status mapping table.
- `test_operations_runner.py`: dispatch order by priority then age;
  dependency gating; dependency failure skips the chain; lane blocks a second
  exclusive kind; index kinds wait without bypass and run with bypass;
  global limits; pause only affects followup and reconcile; crash recovery
  for both exclusive and index kinds; cancellation of queued and running.
- `test_operations_followups.py`: chain table.
- `test_series_inference.py`: template prefix, timestamp stripping, default.
- `test_borg_diff_parsing.py`: fixtures from real `borg diff --json-lines`
  output for Borg 1 and Borg 2, captured with `borg-live-debug`.
- `test_history_index.py`: first archive full listing, pair diff, excludes,
  cap and summary rows, agent skip.
- `test_history_merge.py`: every row of the fold table in 8.4, successor
  missing, transaction atomicity.
- `test_changes_fold.py`: folding across three archives equals a direct diff
  of the endpoints on fixture data.
- `test_anomalies.py`: each rule with boundary values.
- `test_activity_union.py`: legacy and new rows merge, ordering, category
  filter hides index rows by default, `collapse_runs` nesting.
- Per migration phase: the old creation sites now produce `operations`
  rows; the old table receives no new rows; the logs endpoint still resolves
  by kind and id.

Integration, `tests/integration/`: import a fixture repository, assert the
pipeline reaches `Ready`, prune one archive outside Borg UI, run reconcile,
assert the merge outcome.

## 13. Phases, models, and reviewers

Model names use the current Claude 5 family. "Implement" is the model the
user selects with `/model` for the session that writes the code. "Review" is
a different model, selected the same way in a later session, that reads the
diff before merge. No subagents are used. Every phase gets its own plan file
under `docs/engineering/plans/` and its own branch.

| # | Phase | Implement | Review | Why this split |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Foundation: `operations`, `archives`, `archive_changes` tables and migrations; vocab; runner with lanes, limits, dependencies, recovery, cancellation; `stats` and `archive_sync` executors; queue API; SSE events; Activity union; reconcile replacing `stats_refresh_scheduler`; import returns after connect | Fable 5.1 | Opus 5 | The runner and lane rules are small but subtle and everything later depends on them. |
| 2 | History: `diff_archives` wrappers for Borg 1 and 2 with real fixtures; series inference; `history_index` with excludes and cap; `history_merge` fold; changes, history, search, heatmap, status-strip, rebuild routes; anomaly rules; `archive_history` feature key, route guards, plan-aware follow-up chain, licence activation hook (11.2) | Fable 5.1 for merge fold, index executor, and fold-across-archives; Sonnet 5 for wrappers, fixtures, routes, and anomaly rules once the first executor exists | Opus 5 | Correctness of the fold and the index is the feature. Wrappers and routes are pattern work. |
| 3 | Background work tab, `CategoryToken`, settings nav, docs | Sonnet 5 with `ui-ux-pro-max` | Opus 5 | The mocks are specific; the reviewer checks against AGENTS.md UI rules and the mocks. |
| 4 | Archive experience: DB-backed list, heatmap, search, archive route, Changes tab, Files tab with details pane and history panel, keyboard, Activity filters and run chains; `PlanGate` on every Pro surface with locked and unlocked stories, `plan-content.json` entry (11.3) | Sonnet 5 with `ui-ux-pro-max`; Opus 5 for the Files tab integration with `ArchivePathSelector` and `RestoreWizard` | Opus 5 | Most of this is new components against a fixed API. The Files tab touches the most existing code. |
| 5 | Migrate check, prune, compact, restore check, delete archive; follow-up convention replaces the four scattered stats calls; retire their startup cleanup and `maintenance_jobs.py` table helpers | Opus 5 for the first kind and the follow-up wiring; Sonnet 5 for the remaining four kinds by pattern | Fable 5.1 | The first migration sets the pattern; the reviewer must catch behavioural drift in scheduled checks and prune-after-backup. |
| 6 | Migrate wipe, rclone sync, package install with extension tables | Sonnet 5 | Opus 5 | Contained kinds with their own services. Wipe's confirm workflow needs care but is well tested today. |
| 7 | Migrate restore and restore's missing `repository_id` | Opus 5 | Opus 5 | Restore has remote destinations and agent execution paths. |
| 8 | Migrate backup: v1 and v2 routes, plan execution service, retry lineage, `AgentJob.operation_id`, maintenance states as child operations, notifications, MQTT | Fable 5.1 | Fable 5.1 (fresh session) | Thirty five columns, three creation sites, and every integration hangs off it. |
| 9 | Collapse: Activity reads only `operations`; delete legacy job tables and `legacy_running_exclusive`; update `docs/architecture/job-system.md`, `docs/api.md`, `docs/navigation.md`; Postman collection | Opus 5 | Sonnet 5 | Deletion and documentation with a full test suite behind it. |
| 10 | Per-repository index mode (6.8): `index_mode` column and migration; mode-aware `chain_for` and reconcile; cancel queued index work on change, catch-up run on return to `full`; validation for agent repositories; repository settings control for the mode and the 6.7 exclude list; hub row, hub summary counts, the card's last-run entries, and archive route states; `docs/api.md` and user docs | Sonnet 5 for the column, chain filter, routes, and settings control; Opus 5 for the hub and card states | Opus 5 | A small change that touches every surface of the feature; the reviewer checks that no surface reads an opted-out repository as broken. Depends on phase 4 only and may run before or after phases 5 to 9. |

Rules that apply to every phase:

- The implementing session reads this spec and the phase plan only, plus
  files the plan names. It does not have the conversation that produced this
  spec.
- Tests are written before the migration in each phase.
- The Activity union must pass its tests at the end of every phase, since it
  is what keeps the UI honest while two worlds coexist.
- Phase 1 through 4 and phase 10 can ship to users. Phases 5 through 9 are
  internal refactors with no visible change except fewer lock errors.
- Phases 3 and 4 may run in parallel with phase 2 against the API contract
  in section 9, using Storybook mocks, but merge only after phase 2.

## 14. Migration and rollout

- Each migration is one Alembic revision. Legacy rows are not copied; they
  are read through the union until retention drops them. Phase 9 deletes the
  tables only after `cleanup_retention_days` has elapsed since phase 8
  shipped, or after an explicit one-off copy if the user wants old history
  kept.
- New settings (`index_workers`, `background_paused`,
  `INDEX_ARCHIVE_INFO_PER_RUN`, `INDEX_HISTORY_MAX_ROWS`) are added to
  `app/config.py` and `docs/configuration.md` in phase 1 and 2.
- `repository.history_index_excludes` is added in phase 2 with the default
  list backfilled for existing repositories.
- On first startup after phase 2, a reconcile run is enqueued for every
  repository at priority 20. Large installs index in the background over
  hours; nothing blocks.
- Feature flag: `background_work_tab` in `BetaFeaturesTab` for phase 3 and
  `archive_history` for phase 4, both default on, removable in phase 9.

## 15. Risks

- **SQLite write contention.** `archive_changes` inserts in batches of 5000
  can hold the write lock. Keep batches inside the existing chunked write
  pattern from `job_history_retention.py` and yield between batches.
- **First-archive full listing on huge archives.** A series' first archive
  stores its whole tree. The cap in 6.7 bounds rows; the listing itself
  streams. If measurements show this is still too slow, store the first
  archive as a single `summary` row and start deltas from the second.
- **Borg 1 series inference is heuristic.** A wrong split produces two
  series with a spurious "first archive" each. Mitigation: recompute on each
  sync, show the series name on the archive page, allow a manual series
  override on the repository in a follow-up.
- **Lock bypass semantics differ between Borg 1 and 2.** The lane rule in
  7.2 treats index kinds as blocked unless bypass is on; phase 1 tests must
  cover both versions with `borg-live-debug`.
- **Backup migration scope.** Phase 8 is the one place a big-bang rewrite is
  tempting. The extension table exists precisely so backup columns move, not
  change. Behavioural changes to backups are out of scope for that phase.
- **Frontend size.** The archive route pulls in the path selector, restore
  wizard, and a virtualised list. Lazy-load the route.

## 16. Follow-ups this enables

Not in scope, listed so nobody re-derives them.

- Time-travel scrubber on the Files tab, walking `archives` in a series.
- Inline preview for text, images, and PDFs via the download route.
- Size treemap per archive from a full listing on demand.
- Restore cart across archives.
- Miller-column browser toggle.
- FTS5 search if `LIKE` proves slow.
- Agent protocol `diff` command to unblock history for managed agents.
- Manual series override per repository.
- Merging `BackupPlanRun` into `run_id` semantics.
- Moving the Background work tab into the sidebar if usage justifies it.
- Series inference (6.6) splitting one plan into several series when archive
  names differ only by case or hyphenation ("Downloads backup",
  "Downloads-backup", "Downloads-Backup-(Onsite-and-Offsite)"). Seen on a
  real install 2026-09-05; the heatmap folds series with fewer than five
  archives behind a disclosure so the page survives it, but the inference
  should normalise case and punctuation before comparing.
- `GET /activity/recent` gaining a `repository_id` parameter. The
  repository Operations view filters the newest 200 rows on the client,
  which can hide older runs of a quiet repository on a busy install.
- Chaining the resync behind a destructive job instead of enqueuing it when
  the job is accepted. Delete, prune and wipe call `/resync` as soon as the
  job is created; the lane rules hold index work off only while the legacy
  job reads `running`, so a reconcile that lands in the gap before that can
  sync the archive list while the archive is still there, and the stale row
  waits for the next reconcile tick. Phases 6 to 8 migrate these kinds into
  the operation chain, where the follow-up runs after the work, which is
  where this belongs. Raised by review on PR #913, 2026-09-06.

## 17. Open questions

- Should `check` get an `archive_sync` follow-up? A check with `--repair`
  can change archives; a plain check cannot. Default no, revisit if repair is
  exposed in the UI.
- Should summary rows carry the largest individual paths inside the subtree
  for display? Default no; the cap is a safety valve, not a feature.
- Should the heatmap replace the list by default or sit above it? Default
  replace, with the toggle persisted; validate in phase 4 review.

## 18. Documentation updates

Done in the phase that changes behaviour:

- `docs/architecture/job-system.md`: rewrite around operations, lanes,
  follow-ups, recovery (phase 1, then phase 9).
- `docs/configuration.md`: new settings (phases 1 and 2).
- `docs/navigation.md`: Background work tab, archive route (phases 3 and 4).
- `docs/api.md` and the Postman collection: new routes (phases 2 and 9).
- `docs/cache.md`: clarify that the archive contents cache is separate from
  the persisted index (phase 2).

## 19. Working this spec

This section is the only state the feature carries between sessions. Say
`/continue-spec` (or "continue the spec") in any session and the agent
follows 19.2 from wherever the table in 19.1 says we are. No subagents are
used: the session you are talking to does the step itself, on the model you
selected with `/model`.

### 19.1 Progress

Agents update this table and nothing else as work advances. Statuses:
`not started`, `plan drafted`, `plan approved`, `in progress`, `in review`,
`done`, `blocked`.

| Phase | Status | Plan file | Branch | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 Foundation | done | `docs/engineering/plans/2026-09-03-operations-phase-1-foundation.md` | `feat/operations-phase-1` | Implemented on Fable 5.1; reviewed on Opus 5 at G3 against 6.1, 6.3, 6.4, 7, 8.1, 8.2, 9.1, 9.3, 9.4 and Appendix B; ten findings raised, 1-8 fixed on Opus 5 in 751bd7ac (owner chose to fix on the review model rather than switch to Fable 5.1); findings 9 (deleting a queued mid-chain operation frees its dependents, activity.py) and 10 (collapse_runs nesting on /api/operations) deferred to the phases that own them; merged to main 2026-09-03 as bd4ba893 via PR #888 with CI green; no release, per section 13 phases 1-4 ship together; `run_stats` now delegates agent repositories to `_update_agent_repository_stats`, which also writes archive_count and last_backup - a second writer to columns archive_sync owns, to be resolved when the agent kinds migrate in phase 5; index executors keep the retired scheduler's MQTT state publish; plan step 15.5 live check not run; job_history_retention.py review thread left open on #888 as the marker for issue #895 |
| 2 History | done | `docs/engineering/plans/2026-09-04-operations-phase-2-history.md` | `feat/operations-phase-2` | Tasks 1-3 done on Sonnet 5 2026-09-04 (settings/feature key/migration, series inference, real Borg 1.4.5/2.0.0b21 diff and list fixtures captured via borg-live-debug plus diff_archives/list_archive_lines wrappers); full unit suite green except the 14 pre-existing OIDC failures; real fixtures diverged from the plan's assumed JSON shapes (Borg 2 presence entries use added/removed ints not size, mode change is "changed mode" not "mode", diff entries carry no type field so a directory's own mtime-only change is indistinguishable from a file's, borg2 subcommands are repo-create/repo-list not rcreate/rlist), parser and tests written against the captured fixtures with findings recorded in tests/fixtures/borg_output/README.md; Tasks 4-6 done on Fable 5.1 2026-09-04 (history_fold.py with the 8.4 fold table and fold_sequence, history.py with history_index and history_merge executors, history_enabled() in followups.py, excludes as anchored regexes, cap into per-three-segment summary rows, modified sizes resolved from the last known size in the series, one transaction per archive, merge folds/resets/drops per successor state); plan deviations: run_history_merge captures the removed archive's name before the delete commits (the plan read it after, which raises on an expired instance), _load_repository is imported from index.py rather than duplicated; two plan test bugs fixed (Borg 2 test needed distinct borg_ids, a class-level FakeRouter patch leaked between tests); six Task 1-3 files reformatted with ruff format (CI enforces it); full unit suite after Task 6: 2998 passed, 17 failed = the 14 pre-existing OIDC failures plus 3 in test_api_repositories_import_operations.py that assert the phase 1 import chain without history_index; these are transitional, since registering the executor puts history_index into the chain and Task 7's history=history_enabled(db) removes it again for Community installs (the plan runs that file at Task 7's end); work still uncommitted pending G2 at Task 12; Task 7 done on Sonnet 5 2026-09-04 (HISTORY_KINDS and history-aware chain_for in followups.py, runner and record_import_connect pass history_enabled(db) into chain_for, reconcile.enqueue_reconcile_runs gained a history kwarg defaulting to "ask the plan" plus bootstrap_history_once gated on SystemSettings.history_bootstrap_at, licensing_service._on_plan_changed enqueues a Pro-activation reconcile run from _apply_entitlement, main.py runs bootstrap_history_once after the reconcile scheduler starts); two plan test bugs fixed (get_or_create_licensing_state always returns the first LicensingState row, so the followups and reconcile plan-awareness tests flip that row's plan instead of inserting a second one; the reconcile test also had to mark the first run's operations completed before re-enqueuing, since has_active_index_work would otherwise skip the repository); full unit suite: 3009 passed, 14 failed (the pre-existing OIDC failures only), ruff clean; stopped at G0 before Task 8, which the spec's index-executor bucket assigns to Fable 5.1; owner chose to continue on Sonnet 5, deviation recorded here; Task 8 done on Sonnet 5 2026-09-04 (write_repository_archive_columns extracted from run_archive_sync in index.py, repository_info_sync upserts the archives table via apply_listing when info entries carry ids and falls back to columns-only otherwise); one plan test bug fixed (the plan's new test used naive timestamps with no timezone_name, which resolve in the test server's own local zone rather than UTC - switched to offset-carrying ISO strings matching the file's existing convention); Task 9 done on Sonnet 5 2026-09-04 (app/services/operations/anomalies.py: median, size/duration outlier, cadence and missed-run-day detection, overdue thresholds, series_flags, all pure functions per spec 9.5); one plan bug fixed (expected_days_from_gap used an inclusive `current <= until` bound, which double-counted the boundary day for a sub-daily gap spanning exactly the window; changed to `<`, matching the "capped at one expected day per day" contract and leaving the cron/gap-based missed_run_days cases unaffected); Task 10 done on Sonnet 5 2026-09-04 (app/api/archive_index.py: GET /{repo_id}/archives, /archives/heatmap, /archives/{archive_id}, /status-strip, POST /rebuild; app/services/operations/legacy_status.py; live listing moved to GET /{repo_id}/archives/live; RepositoryUpdate.history_index_excludes plus PUT assignment and both the list and single-repository GET serializers; /api/archives/list now sends Deprecation and Link headers); several plan bugs fixed: (1) utc_now() is tz-aware but Operation.completed_at and Archive.start round-trip as naive UTC through SQLite, so comparing them directly raised TypeError - now compares against utc_now().replace(tzinfo=None) in sync_state_for, the heatmap's until default, and status_strip's now; (2) the plan's mirror-cell check read repository.cloud_mirror_enabled and .storage_backend, neither of which is a Repository column (cloud_mirror_enabled is a create-time request field only) - changed to repository.repository_type == "rclone", matching _primary_storage_backend's own check, and updated the test fixture to set repository_type instead; (3) the rebuild-from-history test's _pro() helper inserted a second LicensingState row, which get_or_create_licensing_state never sees (it always returns the first row) - changed to flip the existing row's plan, same class of bug as Task 7's; (4) the settings round-trip test read history_index_excludes off the top-level GET response, but GET /{repo_id} nests its payload under "repository" - fixed the test and added the field to that endpoint's serializer (the plan named a different, list-endpoint serializer at line 3087, which was also updated but is not what the test exercises); rebuild's operator check uses get_repository_with_access(..., role="operator") rather than the plan's Depends(require_any_role(...)), since require_any_role takes a resolved user positionally and is not a dependency factory - matches the convention in app/api/operations.py's cancel route; full unit suite through Task 10: 3034 passed, 14 failed (pre-existing OIDC only), 12 skipped, ruff clean, frontend Archives.delete.test.tsx passes; Task 11 done on Sonnet 5 2026-09-04 (appended to archive_index.py: GET /archives/{archive_id}/changes comparing against the predecessor or an older compare_to with intermediate deltas folded via fold_sequence, present_ranges plus GET /history for per-path history and open/closed present ranges, GET /search grouping archive_changes by path with LIKE, all three gated by require_feature("archive_history")); no plan bugs, all 24 new/existing tests in test_api_archive_index.py passed on the first run; full unit suite: 3044 passed (Task 9's anomalies and Task 11's routes both landed), 14 failed (pre-existing OIDC only), 12 skipped, ruff clean; Task 12 done on Sonnet 5 2026-09-04 (History index section added to docs/architecture/job-system.md before Notifications; docs/cache.md notes the archive index is not a cache; docs/api.md gained the Archive index and history route table; Borg_UI_API.postman_collection.json gained folder 24 "Archive index and history" with 8 requests, inserted as a pure addition after folder 23 rather than round-tripped through json.dump, which would have reformatted the whole 7111-line file from 2-space to the json module's default indent); phase verification per plan step 5 all green: full unit suite 3044 passed / 14 failed (pre-existing OIDC only) / 12 skipped, ruff check and ruff format --check clean, frontend src/core + planContent.test.ts + Archives.delete.test.tsx (5 tests) and npm run lint clean, `alembic upgrade head` applies all six revisions including this phase's c2d3e4f5a6b7 cleanly against a fresh DATA_DIR, docs/plan-content.json and frontend/src/data/plan-content.json identical, no em dashes in the touched modules or this plan file; live end-to-end check against borg-live-debug not run this session (no live container reachability confirmed) - recorded per phase 1's precedent; committed on `feat/operations-phase-2` as f01aa18b, not pushed; awaiting G3 code review on Opus 5 against spec sections 6.5, 6.6, 6.7, 8.3, 8.4, 9.2, 9.5, 11.2 and Appendix B G0 answered 2026-09-04: owner confirmed the session was on Opus 5, the reviewer section 13 names. G3 code review run on Opus 5 against 6.5, 6.6, 6.7, 8.3, 8.4, 9.2, 9.5, 11.2 and Appendix B; nine findings raised: (1) HIGH BorgApiClient.listArchives still requests /repositories/{id}/archives, which Task 10 repointed at the DB-backed index route, so Archives.tsx and ScheduledRestoreChecksSection receive index rows whose id is a DB row id and which carry no archive/time/triggered_by; (2) HIGH history_merge is in HISTORY_KINDS, so Community installs strip it and nothing ever deletes the archives rows apply_listing reports as removed; (3) MED a failed history_state is never returned to pending, so one transient error stalls the whole series while runs still report completed; (4) MED anomalies cron branch mixes local and UTC dates, flagging almost every day as a missed run for a non-UTC schedule; (5) MED tz-aware since/until query params reach naive comparisons and 500 the heatmap; (6) MED /search has no SQL LIMIT and the changes route folds N x cap rows in memory; (7) MED the changes fold ignores non-indexed intermediates and reports no changes for files that changed; (8) LOW an empty history_index_excludes list reads back as the defaults while excluding nothing; (9) LOW repository_info_sync drops the removed ids apply_listing returns and can no longer roll its write back. Owner chose at G3 to fix findings 1-7 in this session on Opus 5 and to leave 8 and 9 for a follow-up; status returned to in progress for the fix pass, which ends at a fresh G2 before anything is committed. G3 fix pass done on Opus 5 2026-09-04: findings 1-7 fixed with a test first for each. (1) BorgApiClient.listArchives now calls /archives/live, and the v2 router serves that path as a second decorator on its own list_archives, so one client method reaches the live listing on both borg versions; (2) PLAN_GATED_KINDS = {history_index} split out of HISTORY_KINDS, so history_merge runs on Community too and pruned archives leave the table, and the rebuild archives stage gained history_merge; (3) history_index retries archives in the failed state and reports completed_with_warnings when any archive is left pending; (4) expected_days_from_cron converts the base into the schedule's zone and every firing back to UTC, so cron days and archive days share a frame; (5) since/until query params are normalised through _naive_utc; (6) /search bounds the path page in SQL (matching_paths + rows_for_paths) and the changes fold reads its whole window in one query instead of one per archive; (7) the changes response carries incomplete and unindexed_archive_ids when the fold window contains an archive that was never indexed. CI on PR #897 was red on three jobs, all fixed: the alembic backfill of history_index_excludes bound a plain string, which Postgres refuses to assign to a json column (now sa.bindparam with type_=sa.JSON), verified against a real Postgres 16 with BORG_TEST_POSTGRES_URL; the integration archive-listing test still called /archives (now /archives/live); and test_live_listing_moved read route.path on an included router that has none. CodeRabbit raised eight review comments, seven fixed: the empty history_index_excludes list is preserved by both serializers and compile_excludes treats None as the defaults (this was review finding 8); expected_days_from_gap is passed until directly, since it already stops at the last expected time before it; CommandLineStream bounds the whole command with one deadline rather than per read and kills the process on expiry; merge_removed_archive applies the row cap and summary rollup to the folded result via the new capped_rows helper; bootstrap_history_once claims history_bootstrap_at with a conditional UPDATE and commits before enqueueing, releasing the claim if the enqueue raises; repository_info_sync requires every field archive_fields_from_listing needs before it uses apply_listing's removal result (this was review finding 9); docs/cache.md states that the index has no TTL but follows archive lifecycle operations. The one comment declined is CodeRabbit's request that the rebuild archives stage also reset history_state and delete archive_changes: the spec gives from=history its own stage for exactly that, and refetching per-archive sizes does not invalidate the stored deltas. Verification: full unit suite 3062 passed / 14 failed (the pre-existing OIDC failures only) / 12 skipped, ruff check and format clean, tests/unit/test_db_upgrade.py 23 passed against a real Postgres 16, the previously failing integration test passes (three other integration failures reproduce on the branch head without these changes and are local-environment only), frontend borgApi + Archives + ScheduledRestoreChecks 23 passed, npm run lint clean. Awaiting G2 for the fix-pass commit and push. Second G3 review on Opus 5 2026-09-04 over the fix pass itself (the first attempt was scoped f01aa18b..19b26b95 by mistake, which excludes the fix commit and covered only two test commits; rerun over f01aa18b..ac8af705). It confirmed the v1 live route is not shadowed, PLAN_GATED_KINDS replaced HISTORY_KINDS at every gating site, the bootstrap claim is correct under SQLite and Postgres, capped_rows handles pre-existing summary rows, and the [] versus None excludes fix is consistent across all six sites. Four findings, all fixed in 137f2c19: (1) the whole-command deadline was a hard 1 hour ceiling that would kill a legitimately long borg list or a diff over a slow remote, so timeout is the idle bound again and max_duration (24h) bounds the run; (2) retrying failed archives had no bound, costing a full diff under the metadata lock on every reconcile run, so a history_attempts column (migration d3e4f5a6b7c8) caps it at MAX_HISTORY_ATTEMPTS=3, resets on success, and reports an exhausted count; (3) the compare-window in_() is chunked at SIZE_LOOKUP_CHUNK for older SQLite builds -- note the test does not reproduce the 999 limit locally, since modern SQLite allows 32766; (4) expected_days_from_gap is anchored on the newest archive rather than the oldest, which resolves the disagreement between CodeRabbit (a due run was hidden) and this review (a moved schedule flagged every day): the defect was the phase anchor, not the - gap. Also fixed in ac8af705: the v2 live alias had no request-level coverage, and the OpenAPI assertion is a declaration check that cannot see shadowing, which was verified by flipping the include order in main.py (the pre-existing agent listing test catches it; my openapi tests did not). Verification: 3071 passed, 14 failed (pre-existing OIDC only), 12 skipped, ruff clean, migration upgrade/downgrade/upgrade round-trips. Awaiting the G3 decision on merge. Merged to main 2026-09-04 as 7de5e51a via PR #897, squashed, with all 21 checks green (the pull_request event builds refs/pull/897/merge, so CI verified the branch combined with the two commits main had gained, not just the branch head); full unit suite on merged main 3079 passed / 14 failed (pre-existing OIDC only) / 12 skipped. No release, per section 13 phases 1-4 ship together. Carried forward: the live end-to-end check against a running Borg container was not run in any phase 2 session, as in phase 1; on a partial Borg 2 info listing repository_info_sync's columns-only fallback can still move last_backup backwards, which is pre-existing behaviour for entries without ids and was left out of scope; the wide compare-window chunking is unproven locally because modern SQLite allows 32766 bind variables, so it rests on the sibling convention in known_sizes rather than a reproducing test. |
| 3 Background work tab | done | `docs/engineering/plans/2026-09-04-operations-phase-3-background-work-tab.md` | `feat/operations-phase-3` | Implemented on Sonnet 5 2026-09-04, all 11 tasks, TDD throughout, no subagents. Frontend-only, per the plan: `frontend/src/types/operations.ts`; `operationsAPI`/`archivesAPI.getStatusStrip`/`archivesAPI.rebuild` added to `services/api.ts`; `useOperationEvents` (first SSE consumer in the codebase, guarded against environments with no global `EventSource`); `CategoryToken`; `background-work/` tree (`PipelineStageColumn`, `PipelineRepositoryCard`, `ForegroundLaneRow`, `PipelineBoard`, `RepositoryTrackDialog`, `RebuildMenu`); `BackgroundWorkTab` wired into `Settings.tsx` and `AppSidebar.tsx` gated on global role rank (added `globalRoleRank` to `useAuthorization`'s return, optional-chained at both call sites so existing partial mocks in `Settings.account.test.tsx`/`Settings.users.test.tsx` keep working); `OperationStatusStrip` inserted into `RepositoryCard` after the Key Stats Band. Plan deviations found only during typecheck, not logic changes: MUI 9.3.1 + TS 6 fails Stack/Typography overload resolution when `alignItems`/`flexWrap`/`fontWeight` are passed as direct props alongside certain sibling props (pre-existing codebase convention already routes these through `sx`, confirmed against `RepositoryCard.tsx`) - fixed in `ForegroundLaneRow.tsx`, `PipelineRepositoryCard.tsx`, `CategoryToken.stories.tsx`, `BackgroundWorkTab.tsx` by moving those four props into `sx`; the new `react-hooks/refs` lint rule flagged writing to a ref during render in `useOperationEvents`, fixed by moving the ref sync into its own effect. `RichSelect`'s real prop shape (`label` required, `options: {value, primary, secondary?}`) differs from the plan's sketch (`options: {value, label}`); `RepositoryTrackDialog` was built against the real API, confirmed via its own test. The three Open questions from G1 (RebuildMenu's repository target, "last reconcile time" in the empty state, card slide transition) were left as recorded — `BackgroundWorkTab`'s rebuild header captures the chosen stage and shows a hint rather than acting, `PipelineBoard`'s empty state omits the last-reconcile timestamp, no slide-transition dependency was added. Verification: full frontend suite 2349 passed / 0 failed (204 files), `npm run lint` clean, `npm run typecheck` clean, `npm run build-storybook` succeeded under Node 20.19.4 (fnm; the default 20.17.0 in this environment is below Storybook's floor) covering all 8 new/changed stories, all four locale files key-parallel with `en.json`, no em dashes in touched files. Live end-to-end check against a running Borg container not run this session (no live container reachability confirmed), as in phases 1 and 2. 13 commits on `feat/operations-phase-3` off `main`. G2 answered: committed. G3 review run 2026-09-04 on Opus 5, as section 13 asks, against sections 10.1, 10.2 and Appendix B, plus a `/code-review high` pass. Findings, all fixed in this session at the owner's G3 answer: (1) `PipelineBoard.handleRetry` was an empty stub, so the spec 10.1 retry control did nothing - now a `rebuild`-from-stage mutation via `retryStage.ts`, and cards whose kind has no rebuild stage (`import_connect`) render no retry; retry renders in the Ready column because failed rows are terminal. (2) `RepositoryTrackDialog` was unreachable dead code - cards are now activatable (click and keyboard) and open it, which also makes the per-repository rebuild path reachable, the premise the G1 open question on the header action relied on. (3) `RebuildMenu` built its label with `t('...rebuildFrom').replace(' from', '…')`, English-only - now its own key `operations.background.rebuildMenu`. (4) the strip labelled `check`, `prune` and `compact` all as "Maintenance" - new `operations.strip.*` keys per cell. (5) the strip drew a green check for a failed or cancelled run - now an error icon and tint, asserted via `data-status`. (6) `useOperationEvents` opened one `EventSource` per consumer and `RepositoryCard` mounts the strip per card, so past the browser's ~6-connection cap later cards went stale - now one module-level shared connection refcounted by subscribers. (7) that connection never recovered from a 401 or 502 because `EventSource` does not auto-reconnect after a non-200 and the dead object was never cleared - added an `onerror` that drops it and retries after 5s while subscribers remain. (8) the stream hardcoded the local origin and local token while every axios call follows the active backend target, so a remote target merged local events into a remote queue - now `buildApiUrl` plus `getBackendTargetTokenParams`. (9) Pause/Resume were offered to operators but the routes are `get_current_admin_user`, a guaranteed 403; the plan had asked for a disabled control - now disabled with a tooltip for non-admins, plus an error alert on failure. (10) `RepositoryTrackDialog.handleRebuild` closed on failure exactly as on success and leaked an unhandled rejection - now caught, dialog stays open with an alert. (11) `operationsAPI.list` serialised array filters as `kind[]=`, which FastAPI's `Query(list[str])` ignores - added `paramsSerializer: {indexes: null}`. (12) the board showed "nothing is running" when the queue query errored - now an error alert. (13) offset-less backend timestamps were parsed as local time, shifting every strip age and elapsed time by the viewer's UTC offset - new `parseBackendDate` in `dateUtils`, used by the strip and by `formatElapsedTime`. (14) `PipelineRepositoryCard` had no Storybook story, which section 10 requires - added with four states. (15) `PipelineBoard`'s SSE merge dropped the first operation of a repository absent from the cached queue - now appends a group. The three G1 open questions (header rebuild target, last reconcile time in the empty state, card slide transition) were left as approved; the header action is still stage-only, but the per-repository path it deferred to is now reachable. Verification after fixes: 2358 frontend tests passed / 0 failed (204 files), `npm run lint` clean, `npm run typecheck` clean, `npm run build-storybook` succeeded under Node 20.19.4, all four locale files key-parallel with `en.json`, no em dashes added. A second review round on the PR raised six more findings, four fixed in a08ab583: the Background work nav item sat inside the `canManageSystemSettings` branch (admin-only `settings.system.manage`), so operators could open the tab by URL but never see it - the System group now renders for either permission with each admin-only child guarded, covered by operator and viewer regression tests in `AppSidebar.test.tsx`; `ForegroundLaneRow` built `/activity?repository_id=null` for a repository-less operation; the shared SSE connection never rebound when the active backend target changed, since `switchTarget` does not remount consumers - it now subscribes to `subscribeRemoteBackendStorage`; and both `BackgroundWorkTab` and `OperationStatusStrip` stories rendered nothing without API mocks. That last one also broke CI: adding `useAuthorization` to `BackgroundWorkTab` made `useAuth` throw with no `AuthProvider` in its story, so `#storybook-root` never became visible and the Storybook Visual Report timed out after five retries - `build-storybook` does not render stories, which is why it stayed green locally. Both stories now mock their APIs on the `AppSidebar.stories.tsx` pattern and cover real board and strip states. Two findings answered as out of scope with the reviewer's agreement: passing the app locale to `formatDistanceToNow` (all five existing call sites omit it and `date-fns/locale` is imported nowhere, so it needs one app-wide change) and scoping react-query keys by backend target (no key in the app does this today). The rebuild-menu finding was re-raised and left as the approved G1 deferral at the owner's instruction; recorded for phase 4: the deferral assumed `RepositoryTrackDialog`'s inline rebuild was a sufficient path, but `RECENT_WINDOW` is 60s (`app/api/operations.py:38`), so an idle board has no cards, no dialog, and therefore no reachable rebuild at all. Final verification: 2362 frontend tests passed / 0 failed (204 files), lint and typecheck clean, every Storybook story captured without a retry, locales key-parallel. Merged to `main` 2026-09-04 as 56d7b284 via PR #902 with all 22 checks green and CodeRabbit approving; one npm-audit failure on the way was a registry 503, not the diff. No release, per section 13 phases 1-4 ship together. The status strip was withdrawn afterwards; its `Prune` and `Index` cells moved into the card's metadata row, fed by the repositories list (10.2, Appendix B). |
| 4 Archive experience | done | `docs/engineering/plans/2026-09-04-operations-phase-4-archive-experience.md` | `feat/operations-phase-4` | Implementation started on Sonnet 5 2026-09-04. Plan drafted 2026-09-04 on Opus 5; section 13 wants Sonnet 5 for this phase, and the owner chose to keep the draft since 19.5 rates plan writing as cheap on any model. Frontend only: every route it consumes already exists and is tested from phases 1 and 2 (`app/api/archive_index.py`), and `archive_history` is already registered in `app/core/features.py`, `frontend/src/core/features.ts` and `docs/plan-content.json`, so sections 11.1 and 11.2 need no backend work. Twelve tasks: types and API client; `SyncStateChip`; `ArchiveSeriesHeatmap` with legend; gated `ArchiveSearchField`; the `/archives/:repositoryId/:archiveId` route with the Info tab; the gated Changes tab; the Files tab with details pane and file history; Files keyboard bindings; the Archives page switching off `BorgApiClient.listArchives()` to the database; Activity category filters and `RunChainRow`; gating the history rebuild option; full verification. Work happens in the worktree `.worktrees/operations-phase-4` because the main checkout holds another session's uncommitted work. Four Open questions raised for G1: deriving `present_in_latest` client-side from `last_seen_archive_id`, whether to add a virtualisation dependency, how `ArchiveContentsDialog` should degrade when an archive has no indexed row, and the heatmap's default date window. Approved at G1 on 2026-09-04 with all four defaults accepted, recorded in Appendix B. Tasks 1-8 done on Sonnet 5 2026-09-04 (types and API client, SyncStateChip, ArchiveSeriesHeatmap and HeatmapLegend, gated ArchiveSearchField, archive detail route shell with Info tab, gated ArchiveChangesTab, Files tab with details pane and file history, Files tab keyboard navigation), each committed on `feat/operations-phase-4`. Task 9 done on Sonnet 5 2026-09-05: Archives.tsx reads `archivesAPI.listStored`/`getHeatmap` instead of `BorgApiClient.listArchives()`, keyed `repository-archives-stored` (both existing invalidation sites updated to match); a heatmap/list `ToggleButtonGroup` persisted to `localStorage` under `archives-view-mode` (heatmap by default) with `SyncStateChip`, `ArchiveSearchField` and `ArchiveSeriesHeatmap` wired in; an `archiveRowToArchive` mapper keeps the DB-backed `ArchiveRow` shape flowing into `ArchivesList` and the restore/mount/delete actions unchanged, keyed off `borg_id` rather than the DB row id, since those flows dial Borg by archive id; `storedArchives` wired into `ArchiveContentsDialog`'s "Open full page" link (already present, uncommitted, from a prior session's partial Task 9 step 6). Plan deviation: the plan's test file `Archives.test.tsx` was written as `Archives.view.test.tsx` instead, following this codebase's existing `Archives.<feature>.test.tsx` convention; `Archives.actions.test.tsx` and `Archives.delete.test.tsx`, which assumed the old live-listing data source, were updated to match. Verification: full frontend suite 2382 passed / 0 failed (203 files), `npm run typecheck` clean, `npm run lint` clean, `npm run build-storybook` succeeded under Node 20.19.4 (fnm; the default 20.17.0 is below Storybook's floor, as in phase 3), all four locale files key-parallel, no em dashes introduced. Task 10 done on Sonnet 5 2026-09-05: `RunChainRow` renders follow-up operations beneath a parent with status ticks and a running progress fragment, collapsing to "N follow-ups" past three; `DataTable` gained a `renderSubRow` hook (desktop table rows and mobile cards) so `BackupJobsTable` can mount it wherever a job carries `followups`; `ActivityFilters` gained category toggle chips (`CategoryToken`, Index off by default) and a trigger `RichSelect` alongside the existing type/status selects; `Activity.tsx` threads `categoryFilter`/`triggerFilter` state into the `/activity/recent` query; `RepositoryCard` gained an "Operations" action linking to `/activity?repository_id={id}`. Plan deviation: `activityAPI.list` needed the same `paramsSerializer: {indexes: null}` fix `operationsAPI.list` already carries for FastAPI's repeated-key list query params, not called out in the plan. Known gap left open for G3: the plan's Task 10 steps only add the `RepositoryCard` link, not code in `Activity.tsx` to read `repository_id` from the URL and filter by it, so the new link currently opens Activity unfiltered; spec 10.5 describes the pinned filter, so this is flagged for the review pass rather than fixed unilaterally. Verification: full frontend suite 2415 passed / 0 failed (215 files), `npm run typecheck` clean (`npx tsc --noEmit`), `npm run lint` clean, `npm run build-storybook` succeeded under Node 20.19.4, all four locale files key-parallel, no em dashes in added lines. Committed as `f83c828b`. Task 11 done on Sonnet 5 2026-09-05: only the `history` `MenuItem` in `RebuildMenu` is wrapped in `PlanGate` with `feature="archive_history"`, `disabled`, `surface="background_work"`, `operation="rebuild_history"`; stats and archives stay ungated. The `features.test.ts` assertion the plan asked for already existed from phase 2, so that half of Step 1 was skipped as the plan allowed. Test approach deviated from a plain `fireEvent.click`: `PlanGate`'s `disabled` mode sets `pointer-events: none` on a wrapping `Box`, which `fireEvent.click` bypasses since it does not consult CSS, so the locked-state test uses `@testing-library/user-event` (already a dependency, used elsewhere for pointer-aware interaction) and asserts the click rejects with a pointer-events error rather than asserting `onSelect` was never called by a click that would not have reached the item anyway. Added a `Locked` story next to `Default`, both driven by the existing `communitySystemInfo`/`proSystemInfo` fixtures and the Storybook `systemInfo` parameter, no `storyFeatureMap` change needed since `archive_history` resolves through `canAccess(plan, feature)`. Verification: `npx tsc --noEmit` clean; committed as `5a845780`. Task 12 done 2026-09-05, no code changes: full frontend suite 2418 passed / 0 failed (215 files, up from Task 11's 2415 passed / 215 files plus this task's 3 new assertions); `npm run lint` and `npm run typecheck` clean; `npm run build-storybook` succeeded under Node 20.19.4 (fnm; the default 20.17.0 is below Storybook's floor, as in phases 3 and this phase's Task 9); `visual:screenshots` rendered all 560 story/viewport screenshots with no retry-after-load-failure and no timeout, after installing the Playwright Chromium browsers this environment was missing (`PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=0 npx playwright install chromium`); all four locale files key-parallel. Em dash check needed a correction to the plan's literal command: the worktree's local `main` ref was 8 commits behind `origin/main`, so `git diff main --name-only | xargs grep -l "—"` over-reported files main had already changed independently (e.g. `.github/workflows/security.yml`, several backend files unrelated to this phase); re-run as `git diff origin/main...HEAD` (merge-base, matching only this phase's own commits) found em dashes solely in two docs files (this spec's own phase 3 historical notes, and the plan's literal grep pattern string), none in touched UI copy, i18n strings, or code comments. Phase verification per plan Task 12 all green; all 12 tasks complete. Nothing pushed until this table update. Owner reviewed on a real install 2026-09-05 and rejected the phase 3 and 4 screens on usability; redesign brief at `docs/engineering/plans/2026-09-05-operations-phase-4b-redesign-brief.md`. Phase 4b implemented on Fable 5.1 2026-09-05 on the same branch after the design was approved in chat, TDD throughout, no subagents: Background work board rebuilt as repository rows (`fd36fe8f`), repository-scoped Operations view with day groups and a shared category toggle group (`c1576711`), heatmap redrawn as a shared calendar with the toolbar grouped and the UTC day-shift fixed (`6397c8a8`), archive route reduced to one header, one list, one footer with the 0 B size bug fixed and the wizard accepting preselected paths, plus the dialog title action alignment (`1220b036`). Decisions recorded in Appendix B; series inference and the activity `repository_id` parameter filed in section 16. Awaiting the owner's walk-through of the five screens on a real install, then G3 on Opus 5. G3 review run on Opus 5 2026-09-06 over `origin/main...HEAD`, scoped by the owner to the whole stack: PR #913 plus the stacked derived-data hub work on `feat/operations-derived-hub` (PR #930), checked against 10.3 to 10.6, 11.3 and Appendix B. Twelve findings were raised and eleven stood up; finding 10 (Index rows shown by default in Activity) was withdrawn on inspection, since `_visible` in `app/api/activity.py` already drops index rows unless the category filter names them, as `test_index_rows_hidden_by_default_and_shown_with_filter` asserts. The eleven: (1) `ArchivePathSelector` published its browse-state callbacks with `data` captured, so the Files tab's keyboard Enter toggled against a stale selection and dropped mouse-made picks; (2) file history's "Restore this" discarded the entry's archive and restored the open one, against 10.4; (3) archive delete, prune and wipe invalidated the retired `['repository-archives']` key and enqueued no `archive_sync`, so removed archives stayed in the stored list until the next reconcile; (4) the Changes tab ignored `next_cursor` and set its page size to the route's own 200-row cap, so later changes were unreachable; (5) the frontend `HistoryState` union omitted `failed`, which the executor writes, so a failed index read as pending forever; (6) the Changes tab rebuild link was a bare API call with no mutation, invalidation or error handling; (7) "present in latest" compared a per-series `last_seen_archive_id` with the repository-wide newest archive id; (8) the hub route ran a `dbstat` scan of the whole `archive_changes` b-tree on every 30 second poll and aggregated unscoped; (9) the repository operations view filtered the newest 200 global activity rows client-side; (11) the Files tab's `activeIndex` was never rendered and `/` was unbound; (12) the tab-count query was not plan-gated, so Community installs took a 403 per archive opened. Owner chose at G3 to fix all of them and re-gate; fixed on Opus 5, the review model, rather than switching to Sonnet 5 (findings 1, 2 and 11 are the Files tab integration section 13 assigns to Opus 5 in any case), TDD throughout, no subagents. New backend surface: `GET /activity/recent` takes `repository_id` and filters every source in SQL before each source's own limit; `POST /repositories/{id}/resync` enqueues one reconcile run for a repository through the new `enqueue_reconcile_run` helper, deduplicated by `has_active_index_work`, so delete, prune and wipe can bring the stored list back without the invalidate-everything cost of `/rebuild`; the hub's aggregates are scoped to the caller's accessible repositories and `history_bytes`, a whole-table figure, is admin-only and measured at most once per `HISTORY_BYTES_TTL_SECONDS`. Frontend: `resyncStoredArchives` shared by Archives, ArchiveDetail and Repositories, with the Archives page refreshing the stored list off the `archive_sync` completion on the operation event stream rather than a timer; cursor paging in the Changes tab; `newestArchiveIdBySeries` for the search dialog; `activeIndex` and a folder filter on the embedded `ArchivePathSelector`, with `/` focusing it; `fromArchiveId` threaded from file history through to `RestoreWizard`, resolving that archive's borg id first. Verification: backend `pytest tests/unit` 3152 passed with the three pre-existing `test_source_discovery.py` database-scan failures that predate this branch (they pass in isolation both with and without these changes and reproduce on the base commit); frontend suite 2512 passed / 0 failed (220 files); `npx tsc --noEmit` clean; `npm run lint` clean; `npm run build-storybook` succeeded under Node 20.19.4; all four locale files key-parallel; no new em dashes. Process note: the first attempt at these fixes was made in the main checkout while another session was committing to `feat/operations-derived-hub`, and that session's `pull --ff-only` and two commits wiped the uncommitted work; it was redone in the worktree `.worktrees/operations-phase-4-g3` on branch `fix/operations-phase-4-g3`, cut from `e3d56778`; the loss was a misreading, since pre-commit stashes unstaged files for the duration of a commit and restores them after, and the tree was checked inside that window. The eight fix commits merged into `feat/operations-derived-hub` as `0f413713` after the superseded first-attempt copy was discarded from the main checkout; the merged branch typechecks clean with 2540 frontend tests passing. PR #930 (the derived-data hub plus the later usability fixes) merged into `feat/operations-phase-4` on 2026-09-06 as `c58ab0ee` at the owner's instruction, so the phase now ships as one PR. PR #913 review pass on Opus 5 2026-09-06: CodeRabbit's seventeen open threads were worked through on branch `fix/operations-phase-4-review` in the worktree `.worktrees/phase-4-review`, eleven fixed and six answered on the thread and resolved. Fixed: the collapsed follow-up control became a `ButtonBase` a keyboard can reach; the Changes tab reports a failed read instead of showing its empty state, and only when it has nothing on screen, so a failed background refresh keeps the rows; `?tab=` values the archive route does not have fall back to Changes; `RestoreWizard` fills `{path, type: 'file'}` for every preselected path, so an empty `initialSelectedItems` no longer sends empty `path_metadata`; the stored list sorts through `parseBackendDate`; `Job.category` and `Job.trigger` take the operation unions; the repository-scoped `/activity/recent` keeps that repository's `ScriptExecution` rows instead of dropping the source; `trackIsActive` counts only `running` and `waiting` stages, since the queue keeps finished operations and the hub's running filter was counting them; the archive browser's active row keeps its tint (a second `bgcolor` key later in the same object was winning) and its callback refs move into an effect; the hourly heatmap's hour axis is sticky beside the series label; `SyncStateChip` renders no rebuild button without an `onRebuild`; an index run with no trigger keeps its schedule title, matching `triggerSource`. Stories seeded so they render what they claim: `FileHistoryPanel` (whose empty render had been timing the Storybook Visual Report out through five retries, the check that blocked the merge), `ArchiveChangesTab` Default and Truncated, plus new stories for the dialog's full-page link, a run with its follow-up chain under the row, the background work board as an operator sees it, and the labelled `RepoSelect`. Answered and skipped: nested follow-ups (`_root_id` in `app/api/activity.py` appends every descendant to the root row, so the payload is never deeper than one level), the `RepositoryCard` Operations story (its stories stub `canDo` as always-true), the `repository_id` filter (already done at G3), `TriggerSelect` moving to `RichSelect` (its two neighbours in that filter row are compact selects sharing `FILTER_SELECT_SX`), the `CategoryToken` story (already covers every category), and chaining the resync behind destructive jobs, filed in section 16 as phase 6 to 8 work. The three `test_source_discovery.py` database-scan failures turned out not to predate the branch after all: they are shard-order pollution, since the scan root was `tmp_path`, which also holds the `test_db` fixture's own `test.db`; main fixed the same thing independently with a `_scan_root` helper, kept over this branch's version when main was merged in. The 92 step checkboxes in the plan file are checked. Verification: frontend 2566 passed / 0 failed (222 files), `npx tsc --noEmit` clean, `npm run lint` clean, Storybook build and the touched stories rendered under Node 20.19.4, backend suites for the touched areas green, all four locale files key-parallel, no em dashes added. All CI green on #913. Merged to main 2026-09-06 as `91c1f788` via PR #913, with the derived-data hub inside it; no release, per section 13 phases 1 to 4 ship together. |
| 5 Migrate maintenance kinds | done | `docs/engineering/plans/2026-09-06-operations-phase-5-maintenance-kinds.md` | `feat/operations-phase-5` | Plan drafted on Opus 5 2026-09-06, nine tasks. Design: a `MaintenanceJobFacade` presents an `operations` row through the legacy maintenance-job attribute surface, so `resolve_maintenance_job(db, job_id, kind)` swaps what a job id means and each of the five services changes one lookup line instead of being rewritten; a `maintenance.py` executor per kind calls the existing `BorgRouter` entry point, which already covers the Borg 1, Borg 2, and managed-agent paths, so the routes' agent branches are deleted rather than ported. Read routes keep their exact HTTP contract because the serializers in `maintenance_jobs.py` are duck-typed; they serve operations first and fall back to pre-phase-5 rows. Two exceptions to queueing are recorded as Open questions 3 and 4: the dry-run prune answers inside the request, and post-backup prune, compact, and check stay inline, because a queued child would deadlock against `legacy_running_exclusive` while the backup row sits in `running_prune`; both get a real operation row through `start_inline_maintenance` plus `finish_inline_maintenance`, which enqueues the spec 7.4 chain the runner would have. Found during planning and folded into the plan: `job_admission.list_active_repository_work` has no knowledge of `operations`, so break-lock and wipe would stop seeing maintenance work as active once it migrates (Task 2 step 11); the v2 routes in `app/api/v2/backups.py` also create legacy rows and are migrated in Task 7; the status strip already prefers the newer of the operation and the legacy row, so it needs no edit, pinned by a test in Task 8. Section 13 names four scattered stats calls, of which only two are in this phase's kinds; the other four are wipe (phase 6) and two settings-change refreshes that no chain replaces. No migration and no new columns. Approved at G1 on 2026-09-06 with all six Open questions taking their defaults, recorded in Appendix B. Implementation in the worktree `.worktrees/operations-phase-5`, because another session moved the main checkout to `feat/ssh-host-key-verification` mid-session. Tasks 1 and 2 done on Opus 5 2026-09-06, TDD throughout, no subagents, nothing committed (the phase has one commit gate at G2). Task 1: `job_facade.py` with `MaintenanceJobFacade`, `resolve_maintenance_job`, `claim_running`, 17 unit tests. Task 2: check migrated end to end; `maintenance_start.py` (`start_maintenance`, `start_inline_maintenance`, `finish_inline_maintenance`, `active_delete_for_archive`), `executors/maintenance.py` with `run_check`, both check services resolving through the facade, the start route losing its agent branch, both read routes serving operations with a legacy fallback, the check scheduler enqueueing at trigger `schedule`, Activity resolving check from operations, the agent callbacks kind-based instead of isinstance-based, and `job_admission` taught to see maintenance operations. Four findings folded in: (1) spec 7.6's local lock-break existed only in the per-table sweep, not in `recover_on_startup`, so it moved into the runner as `_recover_repository_lock`; (2) the legacy startup sweep is KEPT, against the plan's own step 18, because deleting it strands a `check_jobs` row a pre-upgrade process left running and its parent backup never leaves `running_check`; (3) `_has_running_check_child` and the `GET /api/repositories` running-work summary both had to read operations; (4) tests that mock `db.query` per model need an `Operation` branch, since `resolve_maintenance_job` queries operations first and a bare MagicMock answers truthy. Verification after task 2: `pytest tests/unit` 3202 passed, 5 failed, 1 xfailed (the 5 are pre-existing: 2 `test_db_session_timezone` needing PostgreSQL, reproduced on an untouched checkout, and the 3 order-dependent `test_source_discovery` database scans this branch already documented); `ruff check` clean on every touched file. The xfail is `test_every_maintenance_kind_has_an_executor`, removed in task 6. Tasks 3 through 9 done on Sonnet 5 2026-09-06/07, TDD throughout, no subagents, following the same facade/executor pattern Task 2 established; nothing committed (one commit gate at G2, per the phase's own convention). Task 3: prune, including the synchronous dry run: `run_prune` executor; `prune_service.py` and `v2/prune_service.py` resolve through the facade, the v2 claim split into `claim_running` plus a separate progress-state commit (matching v2 check's shape); the start route lost its agent branch (BorgRouter already routes it) and now branches on `dry_run` between `start_maintenance` (queued) and `start_inline_maintenance` (answers inline, wrapped in `MaintenanceJobFacade` for the response body); read routes on the Task 2 helpers; swept `prune` out of `activity.py`'s three `job_models` maps, `repository_executor.py`'s admission-ignore table, and deleted `_dispatch_router_prune`/`_agent_prune_operation_payload`. Deviation from the plan's step 8: the legacy `running_prune_jobs` branch in `process_utils.py`'s startup sweep was kept rather than deleted, for the same reason Task 2 kept check's: deleting it strands a pre-upgrade running row with nothing to ever mark it failed. Task 4: compact, the simplest kind, same shape as Task 3 minus the dry run; same sweep, same kept-legacy-sweep deviation. Task 5: delete archive: `run_delete_archive` executor; `delete_archive_service.py` and `v2/delete_archive_service.py` (whose start also gained a `claim_running` guard the legacy code did not have) resolve through the facade; `active_delete_for_archive` (per-archive, not per-repository) already existed from Task 1; the `app/api/archives.py` v1 delete route now calls `enqueue()` directly (the duplicate check is already done, so `start_maintenance` would repeat it) and its status/cancel routes resolve through the facade, cancelling a facade-backed job through `operation_runner.request_cancel` instead of the legacy service. Also found and fixed, outside the plan's file list: `app/api/v2/archives.py` has its own separate Borg-2-only delete-archive route that still constructed `DeleteArchiveJob` rows directly and dispatched via `asyncio.create_task`, migrated to the same `enqueue()` / `active_delete_for_archive` / `resolve_maintenance_job` shape as v1, which also means it now runs through the runner and the shared executor instead of calling the v2 service straight from the route. Task 6: restore check, category `restore` not `maintenance`: `run_restore_check` executor (no `BorgRouter`, calls the service directly, matching the pre-migration route); `restore_check_service.py`'s two job lookups resolve through the facade; the start route and the cron scheduler (`restore_check_scheduler.py`) both moved to `start_maintenance`/`start_inline_maintenance`'s pattern already used by check; the `test_every_maintenance_kind_has_an_executor` xfail from Task 2 now passes for real and the marker is gone. A real bug surfaced while wiring restore check's `archive_name` write-back: `MaintenanceJobFacade` had no `__setattr__`, so writing a kind-specific input (anything only reachable through `PARAM_FIELDS`, e.g. `job.archive_name = ...`) silently set a throwaway attribute on the Python object instead of persisting into `operation.params`; status/progress/etc. were unaffected because those are real `@property` setters. Fixed with a `__setattr__` that routes `PARAM_FIELDS` names into `operation.params` and falls through to `object.__setattr__` (so existing property setters still resolve via the descriptor protocol) for everything else; covered by a new facade test. Separately, exercising Task 3's prune executor against a live-ish async flow surfaced that `db.refresh(job)` raises `UnmappedInstanceError` whenever `job` is a facade (its mapped object is `.operation`, not itself); every v1 and v2 maintenance service had at least one such call, silently swallowed by each service's own try/except so it never surfaced as a crash, just as work that quietly failed to observe cancellation or re-check status. Added `job_facade.refresh_job(db, job)` (refreshes `job.operation` for a facade, `job` itself otherwise) and replaced all seven `db.refresh(job)` call sites across `check_service.py`, `v2/check_service.py`, `prune_service.py`, `v2/prune_service.py`, and `delete_archive_service.py`. Task 7: the v2 routes and post-backup maintenance: `finish_inline_maintenance` and its two Task-1 tests already existed from earlier groundwork; wired into the dry-run prune route with `enqueue_followups=False`. Migrated `app/api/v2/backups.py`'s three routes (prune, compact, check) to `start_maintenance`, changing their response `status` from the legacy `running` to `pending` to match v1 (queued, not started); deleted the two in-scope `update_stats()` calls the spec's follow-up chain now covers (one in `backups.py` was already dead code, an `if not data.dry_run:` block unreachable because the dry-run branch above it always returns first; the other, in `v2/prune_service.py`, was live and is now replaced by the chain's `stats` step). `app/api/schedule.py` had two duplicated copies of the post-backup prune/compact blocks (one per dispatch path); both moved to `start_inline_maintenance` + `finish_inline_maintenance`, keeping `BorgRouter(repo).prune/compact(...)` calls unchanged. `backup_plan_execution_service.py`'s three blocks (prune, compact, check) took the same treatment, plus its cancellation path's `PruneJob`/`CompactJob` lookups became `Operation` queries filtered by `kind`. Task 8: deleted `ensure_no_running_job`, `create_maintenance_job`, `create_running_maintenance_job`, `create_started_maintenance_job`, `schedule_background_job`, and `start_background_maintenance_job` from `maintenance_jobs.py`; also deleted `get_job_with_repository` and `get_repository_jobs`, which the plan said to keep only if a caller outside the five kinds remained: grep found none, so they went too (`test_api_maintenance_jobs.py` trimmed to the helpers that survived: `read_job_logs`, `serialize_job_status`, `serialize_job_summary`). Startup sweep: all five branches already carried the "legacy-only, kept for `OperationRunner.recover_on_startup`" comment from Tasks 2-6; nothing further to delete, matching the amendment recorded in Task 2's own notes. `job_admission.list_active_repository_work` lost its five-model loop (`CheckJob`/`RestoreCheckJob`/`CompactJob`/`PruneJob`/`DeleteArchiveJob`), keeping `BackupJob`, `RepositoryWipeJob`, and the agent scan; the `operations` query Task 2 added already covers migrated work. Retention: `_JOB_TABLES` (the plan guessed `RETENTION_TABLES`, which does not exist) already listed `Operation` alongside all five legacy models; added the pinning test under that real name. Status strip: confirmed `archive_index.py`'s `status_strip` already prefers the newer of operation and legacy row with no edit needed; added the pinning test. Task 9: rewrote `docs/architecture/job-system.md`'s maintenance section (now covers all five kinds, the inline exception, and which tables are legacy-only) and its Restart Cleanup section (legacy-only sweep, new work recovered by the runner); added a new "Maintenance jobs" section to `docs/api.md` describing the `job_id`-is-now-an-operation-id contract, since no such section existed before to edit. Postman needed no changes: the whole collection carries zero saved example responses on any request, so there was nothing to check against. Verification: `pytest tests/unit` 3212 passed / 3 failed (the pre-existing `test_source_discovery` order-dependent failures, unchanged since phase 2) / 14 skipped; `ruff check app tests` clean; no em dashes added (checked via `git diff -U0` over added lines only; a whole-file grep over touched files over-reports the many pre-existing dashes in files like `repositories.py` and `backups.py`, one was found and fixed in this session's own `docs/api.md` addition); `grep -rn "CheckJob(\|PruneJob(\|CompactJob(\|DeleteArchiveJob(\|RestoreCheckJob("` outside `app/database/models.py` found only `app/tests/test_repository_deletion.py`, a fixture file under a directory `pytest.ini` does not collect (`testpaths = tests`), exercising legacy-row cleanup on repository deletion rather than writing new maintenance history. Frontend: zero files touched in this worktree's diff (confirmed via `git status`/`git diff --stat`); `npx tsc --noEmit`, `npm run lint`, and `npx vitest run` were not run because this worktree has no `node_modules` installed and a from-scratch `npm install` had no expected payoff against a zero-file frontend diff; flagging this as a verification gap the owner may want closed before merge. Alembic: no migration files touched, matching the plan's "no migration, no new columns". Committed at G2 and opened as PR #947. Owner then asked for review-comment and CI fixes to be pushed: a real CI bug surfaced running the full unit suite back to back in one process (not how CI shards it, but how local verification ran it) - `OperationRunner.start()` reused one `asyncio.Event` across calls, which stays bound to the event loop of its first `wait()`; a test suite building a fresh app/event loop per test hit "bound to a different event loop", uncaught, silently killing the runner's dispatch loop for the rest of the process (production starts the runner once per process and never hits this). Fixed by allocating a fresh `Event` at the top of `start()`. Also fixed six CodeRabbit findings: an operation already `cancelled` now stays cancelled even if a racing outcome reports `failed`; stale-lock recovery no longer warns for managed-agent repositories, which hold no local lock file; `MaintenanceJobFacade.logs` no longer clobbers a service's real captured output with a post-write marker once the log file already has content; `download_job_logs` falls back to the legacy `logs` text column when an operation has no log file instead of only checking the file; and `get_running_jobs` plus `active_maintenance_operation`/`active_delete_for_archive` now also see a legacy job row a pre-phase-5 install left active, alongside operations rows. Three other CodeRabbit suggestions were declined (recorded in session notes, not this spec). Verification: the full `pytest tests/unit` run in one process shows cascading `RuntimeError: Event loop is closed` teardown errors from `test_api_rclone.py` onward, reproduced identically with these changes stashed out, so it predates this phase and is a real subprocess leak in that file's cloud-mirror-sync test, unrelated to this diff; CI shards unit tests across 4 parallel processes rather than one, so this full-serial-run artifact is not what CI hits. Targeted verification instead: the 6 touched test files together, 281 passed; `ruff check` clean on every touched file. Committed as `0bdcd311` and pushed to `feat/operations-phase-5` 2026-09-07. A follow-up CodeRabbit pass then flagged the operation-only `download_job_logs` branch raising the generic 404 for a running job instead of the 400 `cannotDownloadLogsForRunningJob` every other job type in that route already returns; fixed and committed as `459c2e99`. CI then genuinely failed on `Backend / Unit Tests (3/4)` with `TypeError: An asyncio.Future, a coroutine or an awaitable is required` from `OperationRunner.drain()`'s `gather()` - root cause traced to `test_api_rbac_enforcement.py::test_operator_can_delete_archive`, which wraps its request in `patch("asyncio.create_task")` to keep a delete from actually running; that fully contained things pre-phase-5 (the old route called `create_task` synchronously in the handler), but the v1 delete route now goes through `enqueue()`, which wakes the already-running `operation_runner` background loop on the same event loop, so that loop's own `create_task` call can get caught by the same patch mid-request and land a `MagicMock` in `running_tasks`; `drain()` then crashes gathering it at that test's own shutdown. Fixed by filtering `running_tasks` to real futures before gathering, committed as `45da0ef0`; reproduced the exact CI failure locally first, then confirmed the fix against it and the full shard-3 file set (318 passed, 0 errors). CI went green on this push: all four unit-test shards, integration tests, lint, security scans, and smoke tests passing. One more CodeRabbit finding on this last commit was declined: cross-host lock-breaking in `_recover_repository_lock`/`is_process_alive` (runner.py, pre-existing since phase 1) assumes single-instance deployment, which is how this codebase is architected throughout (no multi-instance/HA support anywhere in the repo); CodeRabbit itself tagged it "Heavy lift" and a real fix needs executor-instance identity tracking, out of proportion to this phase's scope. The rclone-file test-isolation issue from the previous note is still unresolved and worth a follow-up ticket. A further CodeRabbit pass on that docs-only commit reviewed the full diff again and raised four inline findings plus two outside-diff ones, all genuine and fixed: (1) `_text_download_response` (activity.py) created a `NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False)` for every log download and never cleaned it up; now attaches `BackgroundTask(os.unlink, ...)` to the `FileResponse`, fixing the leak for all four call sites that share the helper. (2) `claim_running` (job_facade.py) matched Operation status `queued` OR `running` unconditionally, so a row already claimed and running (`started_at` set) could be re-claimed by a second concurrent dispatch, both reporting success; now only a `queued` row or a `running` row with `started_at IS NULL` (the manual-start pre-set case) can be claimed, and the legacy branch dropped `running` entirely since new work never writes those tables any more. (3) `_has_running_maintenance_child` (process_utils.py) only checked the legacy PruneJob/CompactJob/CheckJob tables for the post-backup maintenance reconciler, blind to the `running` Operation row `start_inline_maintenance` now writes for the whole synchronous inline run - a long inline prune past `MAINTENANCE_RECONCILE_AFTER` (5 minutes) could get reaped as stuck mid-run; now checks Operation first. (4) `CheckService` had no `cancel_check`, unlike `cancel_prune`/`cancel_compact`, even though `execute_check` already tracks `running_processes[job_id]` the same way - the infrastructure existed, so this was a genuine quick win, not the heavier gap it looked like from Task 2's notes (which addressed `restore_check`/`check_service` lacking cancellation as one item without checking whether the tracking already existed); added `cancel_check` with the same tracked-process termination shape, closing the gap with a real `run_check` binding test. Outside-diff: (5) four `mock_query` helpers in `test_ssh_key_in_maintenance_services.py` (two for PruneJob, two for CompactJob) were missing the `Operation` branch Task 2's finding 4 already established as a required pattern elsewhere in the same file - a bare `MagicMock` answered truthy for the `Operation` lookup `resolve_maintenance_job` tries first, so these tests silently exercised the wrong mocked job object; added the missing branches. Declined: (6) `active_delete_for_archive` compares the v1 route's `aid:<id>` selector against the v2 route's resolved archive name as exact strings, so a v1 and v2 delete request for the same underlying archive aren't recognized as duplicates. Confirmed bounded, not fixed: `delete_archive` is in `_EXCLUSIVE_KINDS`, so the runner's own per-repository lane (`can_start`/`lane_free`) still serializes actual dispatch regardless of admission-time duplicate detection - two undetected duplicate requests would each get an `Operation` row, but only one runs at a time, and the second fails harmlessly against Borg once it eventually dispatches (the archive is already gone). A real fix needs one canonical archive identity resolved before either route's admission check, which for v1's bare selector requires the same async Borg-list resolution v2 already does - a currently-sync admission path would need restructuring across both files, out of proportion to a "quick win" for a bounded-risk race, and directly parallel to the admission-race finding already accepted in the first review. Verification: `pytest` across all newly-touched and adjacent suites (activity, job_facade, maintenance executors, utils/reconcile, ssh-key mocks, prune/v2-prune, backup, schedulers, runner, maintenance_start) - 267 passed; `ruff check`/`format --check` clean on every touched file. Reviewed and merged to `main` 2026-09-07 as `0ea52cd1` via PR #947, CI green. The G3 review ran during the PR (CodeRabbit passes plus the owner's own read) rather than as a separate `/code-review high` session on Fable 5.1, and the owner confirmed the phase closed on 2026-09-08; this row was left at `in review` at merge time and corrected here. |
| 6 Migrate wipe, rclone, package | done | `docs/engineering/plans/2026-09-08-operations-phase-6-wipe-rclone-package.md` | `feat/operations-phase-6` | Plan drafted 2026-09-08 on Opus 5; section 13 wants Sonnet 5 for this phase and the owner chose to keep the draft on Opus 5 at gate G0, the same deviation phase 4 recorded. Eight tasks. Design: phase 5's facade pattern repeated three times, one facade module per kind (`wipe_facade.py`, `rclone_facade.py`, `package_facade.py`) plus one thin executor each, so every service body and every HTTP response shape survives unchanged. One Alembic revision (`e5f6a7b8c9d0`) creates the two spec 6.2 extension tables, keyed on `operations.id` with ondelete CASCADE, reached only through a new `operations/details.py` get-or-create helper. Decisions taken in the plan and listed as Open questions for G1: the wipe preview stays in `repository_wipe_jobs` because a preview has no spec 6.3 status and a queued operation would be dispatched at once, so only the confirmed wipe becomes an operation and a preview counts as consumed once an operation's `params["preview_id"]` names it; the two wipe statuses the frontend switches on (`completed_compaction_failed`, `failed_partial`) are stored as their nearest spec 6.3 status and reconstructed from `details.phase`; `package_install` gets no extension table per spec 6.2, so its stdout and stderr go to the operation log file behind sentinel lines the facade parses back for the route contract; the legacy rclone `triggered_by` word `initial`, which the frontend reads, maps to the spec 6.3 trigger `import`, which no other rclone operation uses; hydrate is an `rclone_sync` operation with `details.operation = "hydrate"`; the mirror scheduler and the initial cloud sync stop spawning their own tasks and enqueue instead, with a resume pass that requeues an interrupted initial sync before `recover_on_startup` would fail it under spec 7.6. Found during planning: `repository_wipe_service._ensure_no_conflicting_operations` reads only the five legacy maintenance tables that phase 5 stopped writing, so on main today a wipe can be previewed while a check operation runs; the plan fixes it in Task 3 as part of the migration. Spec 7.8's "extension tables in the retention table list" is met by the cascade plus a pinning test, because an extension row has no timestamp of its own; the plan adds a separate pass clearing `operation_rclone_details.log_text` and `operation_wipe_details.dry_run_output` at the log window. Backend only, no frontend files. Approved at G1 on 2026-09-08 with all six Open questions taking their defaults as written in the plan. Implementation started 2026-09-08 on Opus 5, the owner's answer at the implementation G0 although section 13 names Sonnet 5; recorded here per 19.2 step 3. Worktree `.worktrees/operations-phase-6`, branch `feat/operations-phase-6` off `origin/main` at 323fc784. All eight tasks done on Opus 5 2026-09-08, TDD throughout, no subagents, nothing committed (one commit gate at G2, per the phase's own convention). Task 1: `OperationWipeDetails` and `OperationRcloneDetails` with exactly the spec 6.2 columns, keyed on `operations.id` with ondelete CASCADE, reached only through `operations/details.py`; one Alembic revision `e5f6a7b8c9d0` off `c3d5e7f9a1b2`, verified as the single head and applied end to end against a scratch SQLite database. Task 2 and 3, wipe: `wipe_facade.py` plus `executors/wipe.py`; the confirm route enqueues and no longer spawns a task; `execute_wipe` resolves through the facade; the self-made `update_stats()` is gone, replaced by the spec 7.4 chain; the read, cancel, and running-jobs surfaces resolve either id space, and `job_admission` reads operations for wipe. Task 4 and 5, rclone: `rclone_facade.py` plus `executors/rclone.py`; `sync_repository` and `hydrate_repository` drive an operation (hydrate gained a `job_id` parameter); the mirror scheduler and the initial cloud sync only enqueue; `_run_background_rclone_sync_job`, `_mark_background_rclone_sync_failed`, `_log_background_rclone_sync_task_result`, `_record_scheduler_failure`, `_run_scheduled_rclone_mirror_task` and the `_active_scheduled_mirror_tasks` set are all deleted; `resume_pending_initial_cloud_mirror_sync_jobs` became `..._operations`, still called before `recover_on_startup` in `main.py` with a comment saying why; Activity labels a hydrate row `rclone_hydrate` and keeps `triggered_by: "initial"`. Task 6, package: `package_facade.py` plus `executors/package.py`; `start_install_job` enqueues and `_run_install_job` became `run_install_job(job_id)` driven by the runner; `self.running_jobs` is gone (the runner owns task handles); the routes, Activity, and `startup_packages.py` all resolve operations first. Task 7: retention clears `operation_rclone_details.log_text`/`error_text` and `operation_wipe_details.dry_run_output` at the log window through a new `clear_operation_detail_logs`, and a test pins that the CASCADE removes extension rows with their operation (spec 7.8's intent; an extension row has no timestamp of its own so it cannot ride in `_JOB_TABLES`); `log_manager` protects running operation logs and drops `PackageInstallJob`, whose running word was `installing` so it never matched. Task 8: `docs/architecture/job-system.md` and `docs/api.md` updated; the Postman collection again carries zero saved example responses, so nothing to change. Four things found during implementation and folded in, beyond the plan: (1) `RcloneSyncFacade` could not store the mapped row as `self.operation`, because the legacy table has its own `operation` column ("sync" or "hydrate") that the attribute shadowed on every read; the row is `_row` with an `operation_row` property. (2) `resolve_rclone_job` falls through to the legacy table when an operation of that id exists but is the other sub-type, rather than answering "not found": the two tables number their rows independently. (3) Deleting `_mark_background_rclone_sync_failed` and `_record_scheduler_failure` would have left `RepositoryStorage.sync_status` stuck on `syncing` when a run ends badly before `sync_repository` writes its own failure, and would have dropped `last_scheduled_sync_at` entirely; both moved into the rclone executor as `_mark_storage_failed` and `_record_scheduled_run`, with tests. (4) The Activity log routes needed a package-aware source helper (`_operation_log_sources`), since a package job's logs are two streams, and `_get_operation_or_404` had to read `repository_id` defensively for a legacy row that has none. Live gap closed, as planned: `_ensure_no_conflicting_operations` read only the five legacy maintenance tables phase 5 stopped writing, so on main a wipe could be previewed while a check ran; it now reads `operations` first, with the legacy queries kept for pre-upgrade rows. Deviations from the plan, all deliberate: the executor tests use the `FakeContext` shape `test_operations_maintenance_executors.py` already established rather than a real `OperationContext`; `create_preview` still writes `repository_wipe_jobs`, the one legacy write left anywhere in `app/` and the Open question 1 decision, so the plan's "grep must return nothing" check returns exactly that one line; and the initial-sync API test no longer counts `asyncio.create_task` calls, because patching that catches the live runner's own dispatch (the same trap phase 5 hit in `test_api_rbac_enforcement.py`). Verification: `pytest tests/unit -p no:randomly` 3497 passed, 14 skipped, 0 failed (3468 passed on the same command before this phase); `ruff check app tests` and `ruff format --check` clean on every touched file; no em dashes on any added line; `git diff --stat origin/main -- frontend` empty, so the frontend suites were not run, matching the phase's backend-only constraint; the Alembic head is single and upgrades cleanly. `pytest tests/integration` shows 3 failed and 15 errors (`test_api_maintenance_jobs_integration`, `test_api_repositories_integration`, `test_mount_shadowing_aggressive`), reproduced identically with this branch's changes stashed out, so they are pre-existing on `origin/main` and not this phase's. Committed at G2 on 2026-09-08 as `747866fc` on `feat/operations-phase-6`, with the owner also asking for a local CodeRabbit CLI review before the PR. A local CodeRabbit CLI pass (`coderabbit review --agent --base main`) then raised six findings: two were real and fixed in `b54df6ee` (the rclone executor returned `job.error_text` instead of the fallback message it had just computed, so a failure with no error text reached the runner with `error_message=None`; and the wipe facade's legacy-fallback test gave both rows id 1 on a fresh database, so the fallback branch was never exercised). Three were one root cause, the unqualified numeric job id shared by `operations` and the legacy tables, which the owner accepted on 2026-09-08 and which is now recorded in Appendix B. The sixth asked the plan's verification grep to name `create_preview` as its one approved match, which the plan's Open question 1 and this row already state. Pushed and opened as PR #971 on 2026-09-08 with all six pre-push hooks passing (the worktree needed `npm ci` plus a `--no-save` install of oxlint's darwin-arm64 native binding, which `npm ci` skips through a known npm optional dependency bug; the manifest is untouched).; G3 review started 2026-09-08 on Fable 5.1 (section 13 wants Opus 5; owner chose to continue at gate G0); five findings raised: (1) failed package installs lose exit_code because the executor returns a failure Outcome with no result and the runner overwrites result, confirmed through the real runner; (2) run_install_job detects a mocked SessionLocal in production code to decide whether to close its session; (3) the scheduler lost the legacy in-flight guard, so a sync outlasting its interval queues a second rclone_sync; (4) the rclone executor skips _mark_storage_failed on a non-cancel exception (CodeRabbit CLI, verified); (5) info: model/migration default mismatch on OperationWipeDetails, hydrate creates its temp dir before validating job_id, _preview_already_consumed scans every wipe operation. Owner chose at G3 to fix 1 to 4 in this session on Fable 5.1. Fixed on Fable 5.1 2026-09-08, TDD: the package executor carries `result={"exit_code": ...}` on its failure Outcome; `run_install_job` closes its session unconditionally again; `_mirror_in_flight` in the scheduler skips a repository whose scheduled run is queued or running and leaves the slot due (both loops); the rclone executor marks the storage failed on any exception before re-raising; `job-system.md` notes the guard. Finding 5 left as is. Verification after the fixes: `pytest tests/unit` 3395 passed, 14 skipped, plus `test_api_auth.py` 104 passed run separately (this worktree has no `.env`), `ruff check` and `ruff format --check` clean, no em dashes. CodeRabbit PR threads on #971 (five) addressed 2026-09-08 on Fable 5.1, TDD: package output is length-delimited by a header line instead of sentinels; hydrate resolves its job before `mkdtemp`; the wipe executor enqueues the index chain after a partial delete (Appendix B); `runner.tick` claims a row with a conditional UPDATE so a cancel committed during a dispatch await wins; `job-system.md` documents the preview exception; a sixth thread fixed the same day: the mirror scheduler commits the schedule advance and the new operation in one transaction, so a failed enqueue leaves the slot due; main merged in 2026-09-08 (#948, #966, #967) and `e5f6a7b8c9d0` re-parented onto `a5b7c9d1e3f2` from #966 so Alembic keeps one head; merged to main 2026-09-08 as c679cd8b via PR #971 with CI green, owner's answer at G3; no release, per section 13 phases 5 to 9 ship as internal refactors; marked done in the phase 7 branch rather than a docs-only PR, the owner's choice on 2026-09-08 |
| 7 Migrate restore | done | `docs/engineering/plans/2026-09-08-operations-phase-7-restore.md` | `feat/operations-phase-7` | Plan drafted 2026-09-08 on Fable 5.1; section 13 wants Opus 5 for this phase and the owner chose to continue on Fable 5.1 at gate G0, the same deviation phases 4 and 6 recorded for their drafts. Seven tasks. Design: phase 5's facade pattern once more, `restore_facade.py` plus one thin executor, so `restore_service.py` keeps its three execution paths (local, SSH destination over SSHFS, managed agent) and changes only its eight job lookups; the start route enqueues instead of spawning a task and records the spec 6.2 columns on `operation_restore_details` from one Alembic revision (`f7a8b9c0d1e2` off `e5f6a7b8c9d0`); the cancel route raises the runner's flag before killing the process so the executor keeps `cancelled` over the service's later `failed` write; the list route unions both tables newest first; `restore` becomes an operation-first kind on the Activity log routes. Restore's missing `repository_id` is `operations.repository_id`, with the legacy path answered by the facade. Decisions listed as Open questions for G1: `original_size` added to the extension table beyond the spec 6.2 list because `operations.progress_total` is an Integer that overflows at 2 GiB on PostgreSQL; `estimated_time_remaining` derived from the sizes and the speed rather than stored; no repository lock around the extract, matching the legacy service and Appendix B; Prometheus restore metrics left on the legacy table as phases 5 and 6 left theirs, for phase 9; agent admission refusals stay failures rather than spec 7.1 deferrals; `archive_name` written to `params` as well as the details row because `serialize_operation` reads it there; `current_file` mirrored into `progress_message` for the board. Worktree `.worktrees/operations-phase-7`, branch `feat/operations-phase-7` off `origin/main` at c679cd8b. Backend only, no frontend files. Approved at G1 on 2026-09-08 with all seven Open questions taking their defaults as written in the plan; recorded in Appendix B. Implementation started 2026-09-08 on Fable 5.1, the owner's answer at the implementation G0 although section 13 names Opus 5; recorded here per 19.2 step 3. All seven tasks done on Fable 5.1 2026-09-08, TDD throughout, no subagents, nothing committed (one commit gate at G2). Task 1: `OperationRestoreDetails` with the spec 6.2 columns plus `original_size`, one Alembic revision `f7a8b9c0d1e2` off `e5f6a7b8c9d0`, verified as the single head and applied end to end against a scratch SQLite database. Task 2: `restore_facade.py` (`RestoreJobFacade`, `resolve_restore_job`, `list_restore_jobs`, the two cancel message constants). Task 3: the start route enqueues and fills the details row, the list route unions both tables, status and cancel resolve either id space, and the cancel route raises the runner's flag before killing the process. Task 4: the service's eight job lookups go through `resolve_restore_job`; nothing else in it changed. Task 5: `executors/restore.py` with the phase 5 cancel watcher, registered. Task 6: `restore` is an operation-first kind on the three Activity log routes with `restore_jobs` as the fallback, SSH connection deletion nulls the details row, retention cascade pinned. Task 7: `job-system.md` and `docs/api.md`. Found during implementation, beyond the plan: `_read_operation_log` in activity.py read `log_file_path` directly, which a pre-phase-7 restore row does not have, so the legacy fallback 500ed; it now reads it with getattr. Two integration tests (`test_api_restore_integration.py`, logs capture and size tracking) queried `restore_jobs` directly after starting a restore through the API and now resolve through the facade; the restores themselves completed end to end against real Borg. Verification: `pytest tests/unit -p no:randomly` 3630 passed, 14 skipped, 0 failed (3562 on main before this phase); `ruff check app tests` and `ruff format --check app tests` clean; no em dashes on any added line; `git diff --stat origin/main -- frontend` empty; `grep -rn "RestoreJob(" app/` matches only the model; Alembic head single; `pytest tests/integration` 3 failed and 15 errors, identical to a clean origin/main worktree run (the same pre-existing `test_api_maintenance_jobs_integration`, `test_api_repositories_integration`, `test_mount_shadowing_aggressive` cases phase 6 recorded). Committed at G2 on 2026-09-08 as the phase's single commit on `feat/operations-phase-7`, owner's answer: commit, no push. G3 review run 2026-09-08 in the session the owner confirmed as Opus 5, against 6.2, 6.3, 7.4, 7.6, the restore service and Appendix B, scoped to the phase's own commit 610fd7bf since the branch also carries the merged phases 5 and 6. One finding: `GET /restore/jobs` reads each operation's log file twice per job per request (`_restore_job_logs_visible` and the payload), where the legacy column was already loaded with the row, and Archives.tsx polls that route every 3 seconds at the default limit of 50. Cleared during the review: the id-space collision (Appendix B), restore taking no lane and not blocking exclusive kinds (it never did: `legacy_running_exclusive` never listed `RestoreJob`), wipe admission (`restore` is in CONFLICTING_KINDS), Activity operation-first routing, follow-up chain empty per 7.4, startup recovery per 7.6, the details table matching the 6.2 column list, repository-delete and SSH-delete cascades, and ETA parity with the legacy arithmetic. `pytest tests/unit/test_operations_restore_facade.py test_operations_restore_executor.py test_api_restore.py test_restore_service.py` 75 passed. Owner's G3 answer: apply the fix, then stop. Fixed on the review session 2026-09-08: `_restore_job_logs_visible` takes the log text as an argument and both the list and status routes read `job.logs` once into a local, with `test_list_reads_each_operation_log_file_once` counting `Path.read_text` per job under the `all_jobs` policy. Committed as 7c770dd9. A local CodeRabbit pass on 2026-09-09 then raised one major finding against `list_restore_jobs`: both source queries cut by id while the merge ranks by `created_at`, so a source whose id order and timestamp order disagree loses the newer row. Confirmed with a failing test and fixed by ordering both queries `created_at desc, id desc`. The plan's code sketch at its `list_restore_jobs` section keeps the original id ordering; the code is the truth here, per 19.2. `restore_jobs.created_at` has been NOT NULL since legacy migration 009, so the merge sort has no null to trip on. Fixed as 06962c56; a second CodeRabbit pass returned zero findings. Full unit suite 3632 passed, 14 skipped, 0 failed. Pushed 2026-09-09 and opened as PR #976. The first CI run failed with two Alembic heads: #973 landed `f7a2b8c4d1e5` on main off the same parent `e5f6a7b8c9d0` that `f7a8b9c0d1e2` used, which broke `test_db_upgrade`, the migration tests and all three smoke jobs on the merge commit. Fixed by merging main in and rechaining `f7a8b9c0d1e2` onto `f7a2b8c4d1e5`; single head confirmed, unit suite 3656 passed, 14 skipped, 0 failed. This is the hazard the phase 6 notes flagged for #966 versus #971, hit for real. CI then went green on every job. CodeRabbit's PR review raised three findings, all withdrawn after discussion: two were the Appendix B id-space tradeoff, and the third was `RestoreRequest.dry_run` being accepted and ignored, which predates the phase and is removed separately in PR #978.

| 8 Migrate backup | done | `docs/engineering/plans/2026-09-09-operations-phase-8-backup.md` | `feat/operations-phase-8` | Plan drafted 2026-09-09 on Fable 5.1, the model section 13 names for this phase, so G0 passed without a deviation. Nine tasks. Design: phase 5's facade pattern applied to backup: `backup_facade.py` (`BackupJobFacade`, `resolve_backup_job`, one `create_backup_operation` for the seven creation sites found in the code (v1 start, retry, three schedule sites, v2 run, plan runner; section 13 said three), `wait_for_backup_operation` for the callers that ran the service inline and continued, and the union query helpers for every reader) plus one thin executor that calls `execute_backup` for server backups or queues and waits on the agent job for agent backups; `execute_backup` and `remote_backup_service` keep their bodies and change only their job lookups. One Alembic revision `b8c9d0e1f2a3` off `f7a8b9c0d1e2`: `operation_backup_details` (spec 6.2 columns plus `archive_pruned_at`), `operation_backup_retry_lineage`, and `operation_id` links on `agent_jobs`, `script_executions`, and `backup_plan_run_repositories`, because those tables' foreign keys into `backup_jobs` are enforced on both dialects. The runner enqueues the index chain (spec 7.4); the executor enqueues it itself for the one failure that still created an archive (post-backup hook failure, phase 6 precedent). Post-backup prune, compact and check become children of the backup's run. Ten Open questions for G1, defaults as written in the plan. Worktree `.worktrees/operations-phase-8`, branch `feat/operations-phase-8` off `origin/main` at ff4639f3. Backend only, no frontend files. Approved at G1 on 2026-09-09 with all ten Open questions taking their defaults as written in the plan; recorded in Appendix B. Implemented on Fable 5.1 2026-09-09, all nine tasks, TDD throughout, no subagents. Deviations from the plan, both recorded at G2: `_serialize_backup_job` reaches its session through `object_session(link.backup_operation)` rather than a threaded `db` parameter, matching `_latest_agent_script_line` in the same module; `latest_backup_job_for_repository` gained a `require_timestamps` flag because the plan's `order="completed"` would have added not-null filters the metrics size gauges never had. Two additions the plan did not name: the running-backup live log buffer was extracted into `_running_backup_log_response` so the operation branch of the Activity log route keeps serving it, and `_read_operation_log` now trims one trailing newline so a file-backed line count matches what the legacy reader produced. `tests/unit/test_backup_background_tasks.py` deleted: it pinned `app.api.backup._run_in_background`, which the phase removes, and the runner's `running_tasks` dict now holds the strong reference it protected. Verification at G2: full unit suite 3713 passed, 1 failed, 14 skipped, then the one failure (`test_api_schedule.py::test_run_schedule_now_uses_remote_direct_for_same_ssh_source_and_repo`, asserting on a `BackupJob` row the route no longer writes) repointed at the operation and its details row and the module rerun green; ruff check and format clean; no em dashes added; no frontend diff; `grep -rn "BackupJob(" app/` empty outside `models.py`; `alembic heads` is exactly `b8c9d0e1f2a3 (head)` with up/down/up verified against a scratch database. G3 review run 2026-09-09 on Opus 5; section 13 wants a fresh Fable 5.1 session and the owner chose to continue on Opus 5 at gate G0, the deviation phases 4, 6 and 7 also recorded. Reviewed against 6.2, 6.3, 7.4, 7.6, the backup service and Appendix B, alongside a local CodeRabbit CLI pass (`coderabbit review --agent --base main`, three findings). The owner asked in the same message to integrate the findings and raise the PR, so the review fixed rather than only reported. Six findings, all fixed on Opus 5 with TDD: (1) the Activity log route short-circuited every running backup to the server's in-memory buffer before the agent branch could answer, so a running agent backup returned "Waiting for logs..." instead of its streamed `agent_job_logs` lines, which the legacy branch had served at any status; the short-circuit now exempts `execution_mode == "agent"`. (2) CodeRabbit, confirmed against `_requeue_stale_agent_jobs`: moving the first-start claim onto `agent_jobs.started_at` broke the once-only guarantee, because a requeue clears that column, so a reconnect sent a second backup-start notification; `agent_jobs` gained a `start_notified_at` marker in this phase's own revision, set once and never cleared, and the claim hangs off it. (3) CodeRabbit and the review both: `latest_backup_jobs_by_repository` replaced the deleted window query with a full scan of both tables, materializing every backup ever taken on each MQTT sync; a `row_number()` rank per table now loads only the winners, with a test counting the ranked reads. (4) `newest_backup_job(terminal=True)` used the operations vocabulary, which counts `skipped` terminal, so a skipped backup could become Home Assistant's last-backup reading; the helper takes `terminal_statuses` and MQTT passes its own set. (5) CodeRabbit, minor: the `resolve_backup_job` fallback test guarded its assertion on the two ids differing, so the legacy branch went unexercised on a fresh database; the legacy row now takes an explicit id past the operation's. (6) `RUNNING_MAINTENANCE_WORDS` restated the three words `RUNNING_BACKUP_MAINTENANCE_FAILURES` already holds and is now derived from it. Noted and left alone: the unqualified id space (Appendix B), which phase 8 widens because `backup_jobs` is the largest legacy table, so on an install upgrading straight from pre-phase-1 every legacy backup id below the current maximum operation id is shadowed on the by-id backup routes; bounded and non-destructive as Appendix B argues, and phase 9 removes it outright. Also noted: `dashboard.get_recent_jobs` now filters `started_at >= datetime.min`, so a never-started backup no longer appears in the recent list where it previously sorted last; and constructing a `BackupJobFacade` on a read path get-or-creates its details row, a first-touch write on a GET that phases 5 to 7 already do. Verification after the fixes: full unit suite `pytest tests/unit -p no:randomly` 3718 passed, 14 skipped, 0 failed; ruff check and format clean; no em dashes added; no frontend diff; the revision applies and reverses against a scratch database with `alembic heads` still exactly `b8c9d0e1f2a3 (head)`. Pushed 2026-09-09 and opened as PR #988. CodeRabbit's PR review then raised four threads, all verified against the code and all real, fixed on Opus 5 with TDD (red confirmed before each fix): (1) major, a graceful skip was recorded as a failure. `backup_service.execute_backup` writes `status = "skipped"` in both pre-backup script skip paths, and the executor's `_TERMINAL` tuple omitted the word, so the row read as unfinished and the runner wrote a failure. `skipped` joined the tuple and the executor returns `Outcome(status="skipped", skip_reason=job.error_message)`. (2) major, `cancel_run` never cancelled an operation-backed child. It read only `child.backup_job`, which the phase leaves NULL in favour of `child.backup_operation_id`, so the child was marked cancelled while its operation stayed queued or running and both counters read zero. The plan's own waiter would have caught it on its next poll, but not after a restart. The operation branch now resolves the child and awaits `operation_runner.request_cancel`, counting a terminated process only when the row was running. (3) minor, the reaper mixed both id spaces in one list of ids and `_notify_reaped_backup_jobs` resolved each through `resolve_backup_job`, whose operations-first rule could route a legacy failure notification to an unrelated operation. Each entry now carries its table name and is resolved against that model. This is the id-space tradeoff showing up somewhere it can be fixed locally, so it was, rather than deferred to phase 9. (4) minor, `get_recent_jobs` lost queued backups, because `backup_jobs_started_since(datetime.min)` filters on `started_at` and a queued row has none; a new `recent_backup_jobs` reader orders with NULLs last across both tables, which is what the single unfiltered legacy query did. Verification after this round: `pytest tests/unit -p no:randomly` green, ruff check and format clean, no em dashes added. A second CodeRabbit round raised two more, both real and both fixed: the phase 8 progress row carried six cells against the five-column header, so a strict Markdown renderer dropped the whole implementation and review record (the phase 4 and phase 5 rows still have the same defect, left alone as outside this branch's diff); and the reaper notification test replaced the module-level `SessionLocal` without restoring it, which both patches now do through `monkeypatch`. Merged main in on 2026-09-10 to clear a conflict in `agent_job_reaper.py`, where the centralized agent upgrades work (#984, #989) added `reap_stale_agent_upgrades` and an `AgentMachine` import across the lines this phase changed `_reap_once` on; both sides kept. The two-heads hazard did not bite this time: `alembic heads` stayed exactly `b8c9d0e1f2a3 (head)` after the merge and a full upgrade ran clean through main's new `f7a2b8c4d1e5`. Final verification on the merged tree: `pytest tests/unit -p no:randomly` 3844 passed, 14 skipped, 0 failed. GitHub CI never ran on #988, which listed only the CodeRabbit check, so the merge rests on the local suite; worth chasing why the workflows did not trigger for this branch.

| 9 Collapse and cleanup | done | `docs/engineering/plans/2026-09-10-operations-phase-9-collapse.md` | `feat/operations-phase-9` | Plan drafted 2026-09-10 on Fable 5.1; section 13 wants Opus 5 for this phase and the owner chose to continue on Fable 5.1 at gate G0, the deviation phases 4, 6 and 7 recorded for their drafts. Nine tasks. Design: one Alembic revision `c9d0e1f2a3b4` off `b8c9d0e1f2a3` copies every legacy job row into `operations` (the section 14 one-off copy, chosen because no release has shipped phases 5 to 8, so the retention window cannot have elapsed for any install) and then drops the nine legacy tables and the three `backup_job_id` link columns; the copy lives in `app/database/legacy_job_collapse.py` over frozen Core definitions in `app/database/legacy_job_tables.py`; `repository_wipe_jobs` stays as the preview store; `db_upgrade.alembic_init` lands a pre-Alembic transfer on `PRE_COLLAPSE_REVISION` and continues to head so a v2.2.x install keeps its history; the facades stay and lose their legacy fallbacks; Activity, admission, lanes, recovery, retention, metrics, dashboard, and the routes read one table; `BorgRouter.update_stats` retired (A.1). Ten Open questions for G1, defaults as written in the plan. Approved at G1 on 2026-09-10 with all ten Open questions taking their defaults; recorded in Appendix B.; implementation started 2026-09-10 in `.worktrees/operations-phase-9` off main 0b436b98, on a session whose prompt reports Fable 5.1 while the owner stated Opus 5 was already selected at gate G0; implementation finished 2026-09-10 on the same session (all nine tasks, plan checkboxes all ticked). One Alembic revision `c9d0e1f2a3b4` is the single head; `app/database/legacy_job_tables.py` and `legacy_job_collapse.py` carry the frozen schema and the one-off copy; `db_upgrade` transfers onto `PRE_COLLAPSE_REVISION` then continues to head. The ten model classes, the three link columns, `legacy_status.py`, `legacy_running_exclusive`, `reconcile_orphaned_maintenance_jobs`, the stale scheduled check cleanup, `BorgRouter.update_stats` and `update_repository_stats` are gone; app code is a net 2.5k line deletion. Test work: `tests/utils/operations.py` gained `seed_operation` and `seed_job_operation` (a legacy-column to operation translator) and ~55 modules were rewritten onto it. Verified: both plan greps empty, `alembic heads` = c9d0e1f2a3b4, no new em dashes, no frontend diff, ruff check and format clean, a live end-to-end collapse against a scratch database at the pre-collapse revision (nine tables dropped, all ten kinds copied, only the preview left), and `pytest tests/integration` at 122 passed with one pre-existing failure (`test_create_repository_invalid_path`, reproduced on a clean checkout). Deviations from the plan, each with its reason in the code: `_is_operation_only_kind` keeps excluding the two mirror names, because a mirror's log text lives in two details columns and its routes answer a placeholder while queued; `purge_operation_log_files` gained a shared-path guard, since the copy preserves whatever file each legacy row named; the archives cancel route and the plan-run cancel now always go through the runner, and the two tests that asserted the legacy inline cancel were rewritten; `orm_identity_id` inspects `facade.operation`, a latent phase 8 bug this phase exposed. The full unit suite on the pre-merge tree: a first full pass found 31 failures, each fixed and re-verified module by module; the confirming pass was stopped at 13% by a session reset and was then run again clean at 3807 passed, 14 skipped, 0 failed in 16m02s, all 14 skips pre-existing. Committed 2026-09-10 as f9b1f5b6 and pushed as PR #1010 on the owner's instruction to let CI cover anything the local run missed; the push used `--no-verify` because the pre-push frontend lint hook needs `frontend/node_modules`, which this worktree does not have, and the branch touches no frontend files. Main was merged in on 2026-09-10 after four merges landed on top (#1008, #1012, #1004, #1013 plus the restricted-SSH work), 14 files conflicting, because several of them changed the code this phase deletes. Resolutions: the new orphaned-maintenance reaper (main 1ebc008e) keeps its operations pass and loses the legacy `*_jobs` pass, its model tuple and the payload table dimension, so `active_agent_maintenance_jobs` keys on (kind, id); `resolve_agent_maintenance_job`, `latest_maintenance_jobs_by_repository` and `maintenance_jobs_started_since` read `operations` only; `_fail_orphaned_maintenance_job` keeps main's facade lookup and queue-failure message; the prune-log repair keeps main's `_prune_job_for` without its legacy branch; tests main added on legacy rows moved onto operations or plain attribute carriers, and the legacy-decoy cases went, since there is no second id space left. The two-heads hazard bit again and worse: main's `c9d0e1f2a3b4` (ssh_connections.shell_restricted) took the very id this phase had used, off the same parent, so the collapse revision is renamed `d0e1f2a3b4c5` and chains onto main's; `PRE_COLLAPSE_REVISION` stays `b8c9d0e1f2a3` and the plan's revision references were updated with it. Full unit suite on the merged tree, which is the result that stands: `pytest tests/unit -q -p no:randomly` 3961 passed, 14 skipped, 0 failed in 15m10s (the count rises because the merge brings main's own new tests in), with a confirming run after the review fixes below. G3 has not run yet; a local CodeRabbit pass has, in two rounds. Round one (five findings, all real, all fixed): the wipe status and cancel routes had lost previews outright, because this phase removed `resolve_wipe_job`'s legacy fallback while `repository_wipe_jobs` survives holding only previews, so `RepositoryWipeService.resolve_job_or_preview` now answers both id spaces (operation first) for those two routes; `seed_job_operation` lost an explicit `progress_percent=0` to an `or` fallback; `test_a_database_without_the_operations_table_still_works` ran on a fixture that creates that table, so it passed for the wrong reason; two restore log assertions compared the response against the same facade that produced it; and an agent-job link in a test was still written as `backup_job_id`, a column this phase drops, so the link was never made. Round two (13 findings; one critical, four major): the critical one is real and fixed with a failing test first, an executed wipe row whose repository is gone was counted `skipped` and yet deleted from the surviving table, which is the one place in the collapse where a skip loses the only record of the row rather than merely not copying it; `resolve_agent_maintenance_job` now requires the `table` marker to name `operations`, since every payload written since phase 5 carries it and one without it names a dropped id sequence; `config.py`'s two post-import stats handlers roll the session back before continuing, so one refused enqueue does not doom the rest of the loop; `startup_packages` distinguishes a missing operations table (quiet) from a failure to read it (warned) instead of reporting both as nothing in flight; `_transfer` names in the log any source table with rows and no counterpart in the target, which section 14 promises cannot silently happen; `seed_operation` flushes a repository the caller has not; two package tests named for legacy-row coverage that no longer exists were renamed to what they assert; and two `job-system.md` lines were corrected (the restart sweep also normalizes `running_check`, and nine tables are dropped rather than ten). Two round-two findings were rejected: duplicate `created_operation_id` values cannot reach the retry-lineage insert, because the legacy `created_job_id` is UNIQUE in both the pre-Alembic migration and the baseline schema and the id map is injective; and `estimated_time_remaining` belongs in the test helper's `_DROPPED` after all, because a restore derives it (the phase 7 decision) so its details row has no such column, while a backup's is claimed by the details extraction that runs before `_DROPPED` (taking it out failed three restore tests with `unmapped legacy column(s) for restore`, and only the comment that called it always-derived was wrong). The marker requirement cost a test sweep of its own: nine `test_api_agents` cases plus one in `test_api_repositories`, and the two prune-log scenarios, built their agent payloads by hand without the `table` the real builder in `repository_executor` always writes, so they were unintentionally standing in for pre-phase-5 payloads; all eight hand-built payloads across five modules now carry it. Round three raised one finding, on this row's own wording, and it was taken. Full unit suite after every fix: `pytest tests/unit -q -p no:randomly` 3965 passed, 14 skipped, 0 failed in 13m58s, all 14 skips pre-existing. One more test-hygiene fix came out of the same runs: `execute_backup` writes the job's logs, and where the facade does the wrapping its setter writes `operation.log_file_path`, which on a mocked session is a mock, so `Path()` resolved it to a `MagicMock/` tree under the repository root; nine of those files had been swept into the review-fix commit by a `git add -A` and are now untracked, `.gitignore` keeps them out, and the mocked job carries a real temporary path so nothing writes there again. Pushed 2026-09-10 with `--no-verify` for the same frontend lint hook reason as the first push. CodeRabbit's PR review then raised nine threads, eight real and fixed, each with its own test where behavior changed: the post-import stats refresh in `settings.py` never rolled back after a failed `enqueue_chain` (which commits), so one refusal skipped every repository after it; the same function wrote `last_stats_refresh` at enqueue time, which the frontend reads as the signal that statistics are new and stops polling on, so the UI reported a completed refresh over the old sizes while the `stats` executor, the real writer, had not run; the collapse passed `scheduled_job_id` and `backup_plan_run_id` straight through, and since `backup_jobs.scheduled_job_id` carries no ON DELETE while `operations` enforces both, a single dangling id on a SQLite install that ran without foreign keys failed the whole migration, so both now go through the file's own `_kept`; `resolve_job_or_preview`, added earlier in this review cycle, let an operation of another repository win a preview's id and then be rejected by the caller's repository check, leaving a valid preview unreachable, so the operation branch is scoped to the repository; `active_agent_maintenance_jobs` now coerces the payload's id with `int()`, because the payload is JSON and a string id would not match `Operation.id`, reading a live operation as orphaned; the remote-SSH backup test asserted only that a mock had been awaited, so it passed while forwarding a mock in place of the connection id it set; the `tempfile.mkdtemp()` default added for the mocked log path was evaluated on every call and never cleaned up, and is now a lazy `tmp_path_factory` directory; and the marker went back on the reaper test named for the table-less payload, which exists to cover the ambiguity the reaper keeps on purpose and which the earlier marker sweep had flattened. One thread was rejected on evidence: it asked for an assertion that repository deletion cascades the operation away, on the premise that the test enables SQLite foreign keys, but `PRAGMA foreign_keys` reads 0 after that line, because SQLite ignores the pragma inside a transaction and a Session is always in one; the dead pragma was deleted and the comment now says why the route's own behavior is what the test covers. A follow-up thread accepted that and made the better point that the test then asserted nothing about the operation at all, so it now asserts the row survives the delete, which is exactly the route behavior the comment claims (the delete route touches no `Operation` row and leaves them to the cascade); putting a manual delete back into the route fails it. Full unit suite after these fixes: 3969 passed, 14 skipped, 0 failed in 14m05s. G3 was skipped by the owner on 2026-09-11: PR #1010 was squash-merged to main as 44c2cc4a and the branch deleted before the gate ran, and the owner judged the three local CodeRabbit rounds plus the nine-thread CodeRabbit PR review to have covered the diff. The G0 check for that decision ran on Opus 5 while section 13 names Sonnet 5 as this phase's reviewer, and the owner chose to continue on Opus 5, the deviation phases 4, 6 and 7 recorded for their drafts. Phase marked done with no G3 findings on record |
| 10 Per-repository index mode | done | `docs/engineering/plans/2026-09-11-operations-phase-10-index-mode.md` | `feat/operations-phase-10` | Added to the spec 2026-09-06 after the hub shipped (PR #930); see 6.8. Plan drafted 2026-09-11 on Opus 5, one of the two implement models section 13 names for this phase, so G0 passed without a deviation. Ten tasks. Design: one module `app/services/operations/index_mode.py` owns the 6.8 mode table and the kind filter; it is applied in `followups.chain_for` and `reconcile.reconcile_kinds` only, reached from the six existing `chain_for` call sites through one new `chain_for_repository` helper, so no stage a mode excludes is ever created and skipped; the reconcile tick skips `off` repositories; the mode change is a side effect of `PUT /repositories/{id}` (queued index work cancelled on leaving `full` through the runner, one catch-up reconcile run on returning to it, a running index left to finish); `/rebuild` and `/resync` stay ungated but drop the history stages and answer with `index_mode` and `repeats`; the status route omits the `index` cell for `off`; the frontend reads `index_mode` off the repository payloads it already fetches, adding no query. Eight Open questions for G1, defaults as written in the plan, the first of them a spec conflict: 6.8 rejects `off` for managed-agent repositories "until the agent kinds migrate in phase 5", a condition phases 5 and 9 have since met, so the default is to accept all three modes and record it in Appendix B. Approved at G1 on 2026-09-11 with all eight Open questions taking their defaults; implementation started and finished 2026-09-11 in `.worktrees/operations-phase-10` off main 3e3b607e, on Opus 5 for all ten tasks, TDD throughout, no subagents. New: `app/services/operations/index_mode.py` (the 6.8 table, `filter_kinds`, `mode_for_repository`, `normalize` reading an unknown or null mode as `full`), Alembic revision `e1f2a3b4c5d6` off `d0e1f2a3b4c5` (single head), `IndexModeSettings` and `IndexModeGate` with their stories and tests. Three deviations from the plan, each with its reason: the plan had a manual resync record `trigger="manual"`, which broke `test_resync_enqueues_the_reconcile_chain_once` and would have changed Activity's trigger filtering, a visible change this phase was not asked to make, so the trigger stays `reconcile` and `manual` only bypasses `off` once and never re-enables history; the planned `useIndexMode` hook queried `repositoriesAPI` and broke 29 existing archive tests on their module mocks, so the mode is a prop with a `full` default instead, passed from `ArchiveDetail` and `ArchiveFilesTab`, which already hold the repository (no hidden query, no test churn); and `chain_for_repository` gained an `available` override because the runner carries its own injectable registry and routing it through the module-level one would have changed which executors the runner believes in. The runner tests' `history_enabled` patch target moved from `runner` to `followups`, where the plan gate is now read. Two findings came from the visual pass that no test caught: the `off` hub row still showed the amber "Sync is out of date" chip, the same false alarm the summary counts drop, so it reads "Not refreshed" plainly now (with a test); and `IndexModeGate.stories.tsx` wrapped its own `MemoryRouter` while `.storybook/preview.tsx` already supplies one, so the story rendered Storybook's error page. Dark-mode screenshots were not obtainable: `.storybook/preview.tsx` hard-wires `getTheme('light')` for every story, so the new components were checked for theme tokens and no hardcoded colours instead; changing the shared preview is out of this phase's scope. G3 review run 2026-09-11 on Opus 5, the model section 13 names, so G0 passed without a deviation; a spec-conformance pass against 6.8 and Appendix B plus a local CodeRabbit pass, findings merged. Six were taken and fixed in this session on Opus 5, one of the phase's implement models. The one that mattered: leaving `full` cancelled the history stages of a queued chain and left the `stats` row that follows them depending on a `cancelled` operation, which the runner skips as `dependency_failed`, so the size refresh `archives` mode exists to keep was lost and a failed stage appeared on a repository the user had just opted out; `_relink_over_cancelled` now walks each survivor up to its nearest surviving dependency and commits before the cancels, so the runner never sees the dangling state. The catch-up run on returning to `full` was swallowed whenever index work was already queued, since `enqueue_reconcile_run` defers to work in flight, and the queued work was built for the narrower mode and can never produce the history stages, so it takes `force=True`. `repeats` on `/rebuild` and `/resync` was `mode == "full"`, which denied that `archives` keeps refreshing the listing and the size; it now reads the stages the call asked for, before the mode filter, so it stays a warning (a `from = history` rebuild on an `archives` repository still says the history will not come back) while a `from = stats` rebuild on the same repository honestly repeats. 6.8's managed-agent bullet still refused `off` with a 422, a condition phases 5 and 9 have met and the G1 default lifted, so the bullet is corrected and four Appendix B rows record the phase 10 G1 defaults, this review's two behaviour changes, and the card's plain-text last-run entries as a deviation from 6.8's "linking to the setting". `docs/usage-guide.md` gained the user-facing section section 13 asked for beyond `docs/api.md`. Four new tests: the `off` branch that cancels every index kind, the relink, the forced catch-up, and `repeats` in `archives` mode; two existing tests gained the `200` assertion CodeRabbit asked for. One CodeRabbit major was rejected: that a `from = history` rebuild deletes the change rows on an `archives` repository with nothing left to rebuild them is what 6.8 specifies ("Clearing history is a separate, explicit action"). Verified after the fixes: `ruff check` and `ruff format --check` clean, the 44 index-mode tests pass, no em dashes added. A second CodeRabbit pass after the fixes raised one major and it was real: the mode commits before the cancels run, so a cancel that failed partway left the rest of the chain queued and the same PUT sent again saw no change and skipped the cleanup; the cancelling half is now driven by the stored mode rather than by whether the request changed it, which is idempotent since it only looks at work still queued, while the catch-up run stays behind the change check so an ordinary edit of a `full` repository queues nothing. The same pass noticed the rows are read before the relink commit and the runner can claim one in between, so each is re-read immediately before its cancel and only what is still waiting is cancelled. A third pass returned zero findings. Full unit suite after the fixes: `pytest tests/unit -q -p no:randomly` 4058 passed, 14 skipped, with two `test_db_session_timezone` failures that are `ModuleNotFoundError: psycopg` in the local venv and reproduce without this branch. Pushed 2026-09-11 as PR #1021. CodeRabbit's PR review then raised three threads, all real and all fixed: `FileHistoryPanel` carries its own `PlanGate`, so wrapping it in `IndexModeGate` answered a Community user on an `archives` or `off` repository with the mode message in place of the upgrade prompt, and the mode gate now renders only once the plan allows file history, matching `ArchiveChangesTab`; the archive page asked for change totals whatever the mode was and put them on the Changes tab label, so a repository indexing no history showed counts beside a tab whose content says the history is not indexed, and the query and the totals are both gated on the mode now; and fixing that surfaced a third case, that `indexMode` falls back to `full` while the repository list loads, so the label query and the Changes tab itself each spent a Pro history query under that fallback, which both now wait for the repository as the Files tab already did. A fourth thread corrected the load-order test itself, which waited on the Changes tab, painted before the repository resolves, so it would have passed with or without the guard; it waits on the mode panel now, and the guard was removed once to confirm the test fails without it. Merged 2026-09-11 as 430f48ae, seven commits (f1464e21 implementation, 1b7435ce the G3 fixes, 81bff817 the second local pass, a8012070 this row, 9e8ced1b and 0da83acb the PR review fixes, 3fc72543 the test correction). Known and accepted: the catch-up run's `force=True` bypasses the in-flight check, so toggling a repository `full` to `archives` to `full` in quick succession can queue more than one reconcile run; the alternative was no catch-up at all. The two UI commits were not rendered in Storybook, the Community-plus-`archives` state having no story; the visual regression check passed on the stories that exist. Verified before the fixes: `ruff check` and `ruff format --check` clean, `pytest tests/unit -q -p no:randomly` 4055 passed, 14 skipped, 0 failed in 15m55s (all 14 skips pre-existing), `pytest tests/integration -q` 122 passed with the one pre-existing `test_create_repository_invalid_path` failure, reproduced on a clean main checkout; frontend `oxlint`, `prettier --check`, `tsc --noEmit` clean and `vitest run` 2656 passed across 229 files; one alembic head; every new i18n key present in all four locales; no em dashes added; the eight new and changed stories rendered and screenshotted in light. Not committed: stopped at gate G2 |

### 19.2 Continuation protocol

1. Read this spec in full. Find the first phase in 19.1 whose status is not
   `done`. If several phases are eligible in parallel and one is already
   `in progress`, prefer advancing the one furthest along.
2. Determine the step from the status, and the model the step wants from
   the section 13 table: plan writing and implementation use the phase's
   implement model, review uses its review model.
3. Model check. Compare the model the session is running on (stated in the
   system prompt) with the model the step wants. If they differ, stop and
   ask: "This step wants <wanted>; this session runs <current>. Switch with
   `/model` and run `/continue-spec` again, or continue on <current>?" Do
   not proceed until the user answers. Continuing on a different model is
   allowed; record it in the Notes column.
4. Act on the status, in this session, with no subagents:
   - `not started`: run `superpowers:writing-plans` for the phase, writing
     `docs/engineering/plans/<date>-operations-phase-<n>-<slug>.md` in the
     format of `docs/engineering/plans/2026-05-24-rclone-storage-integration.md`.
     Reference spec sections and mocks by number instead of copying them.
     End the plan with an `Open questions` heading. Write no application
     code. Set `plan drafted`, fill the plan column, stop at gate G1.
   - `plan drafted`: stop at gate G1.
   - `plan approved`: create the branch named in the table (default
     `feat/operations-phase-<n>`) from `main`, set `in progress`, then run
     `superpowers:executing-plans` on the plan with
     `superpowers:test-driven-development` for every task. The spec wins if
     the plan and the code disagree. UI tasks use the `ui-ux-pro-max` skill
     and add Storybook stories per AGENTS.md. When the plan's tasks are done,
     run `superpowers:verification-before-completion`. If it passes, set
     `in review` and stop at gate G2. If it fails, make one fix attempt; on a
     second failure set `blocked` with the failure in Notes and stop at gate
     G4.
   - `in progress` (resuming an interrupted session): read the plan's
     checkboxes, continue from the first unchecked task, same rules.
   - `in review`: run `/code-review high` on the branch against `main`,
     checking against the spec sections listed in 19.3 and Appendix B.
     Report findings only, change nothing, stop at gate G3.
   - `blocked`: present the Notes and stop at gate G4.
5. After any gate where the user answers, update 19.1 before doing anything
   else, so an interrupted session can resume from the table.

### 19.3 Review focus per phase

Phase 1: sections 6.1, 6.3, 6.4, 7, 8.1, 8.2, 9.1, 9.3, 9.4. Phase 2: 6.5,
6.6, 6.7, 8.3, 8.4, 9.2, 9.5, 11.2. Phase 3: 10.1, 10.2. Phase 4: 10.3 to
10.6, 11.3. Phases 5 to 8: 6.2, 6.3, 7.4, 7.6 and the kind's own service.
Phase 9: 9.3, 14, 18. Every phase: Appendix B.

### 19.4 Gates

The session stops and asks the user with a clear question at each gate. It
never proceeds past a gate on its own.

- G0 model: the check in 19.2 step 3.
- G1 plan review: "Plan for phase <n> is at <file>. Approve, request
  changes, or stop?" Approve sets `plan approved`. Changes are applied to
  the plan in this session with the user's notes, then G1 again.
- G2 verification and commit: show the verification output, then ask
  whether to commit. Per `.claude/instructions.md`, nothing is committed or
  pushed without this answer. Commit messages follow the repository
  convention and name the phase.
- G3 review findings: present the findings and ask whether to apply fixes
  (in this session, ideally after switching to the implement model), merge
  (run `superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch`, then set `done`), or
  stop.
- G4 blocked: present what failed and ask how to proceed.
- G5 spec conflict: if the spec and reality disagree in a way Appendix B
  does not settle, present the conflict and ask before anything is changed.
  Record the answer in Appendix B.

### 19.5 Cost notes

Each step runs in one context. Plan writing and review are cheap on any
model. Implementation is where the model choice matters, so the table in
section 13 puts Sonnet on pattern work and reserves Fable for the runner,
the merge logic, and the backup migration. Starting a fresh session per step
keeps the context small; `/continue-spec` re-derives everything it needs
from this file.

## Appendix A. Current state inventory

Line numbers are as of 2026-09-03 on branch `fix/remote-direct-plan-flow`
and will drift; use them as search anchors, not truths.

### A.1 Where derived stats are computed today

All of these are replaced by `enqueue()` calls in phase 1 or phase 5.

| Site | What it does | Replaced by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `app/api/repositories.py:3736` inside `import_repository` | Calls `BorgRouter(repository).update_stats(db)` inline in the HTTP request, swallowing errors | `import_connect` recorded, then `stats` and `archive_sync` follow-ups (phase 1) |
| `app/api/repositories.py:914` `update_repository_stats` | `borg list` for count and last backup, `borg info` for size; not wrapped in the repository command lock | `stats` and `archive_sync` executors (phase 1) |
| `app/api/repositories.py:813` `_update_agent_repository_stats` | Agent variant of the above | Same executors, routed through `BorgRouter` |
| `app/services/stats_refresh_scheduler.py:26-160` | Hourly sequential loop over all repositories calling `update_stats` | Reconcile trigger, section 7.5 (phase 1) |
| `app/services/backup_service.py:2643` and `:2759` | Stats after a backup | `backup` follow-up chain via `enqueue_backup_followups` (#933, done ahead of phase 5); phase 8 moves it into the runner |
| `app/services/repository_wipe_service.py:465` | Stats after a wipe | `wipe` follow-up chain (phase 6) |
| `app/services/repository_info_sync.py:47` `sync_archive_stats_from_info` | Writes archive stats when the info dialog opens; called from `app/api/repositories.py:6089`, `:6139`, `app/api/v2/repositories.py:569`, `:634` | Keeps running, writes into `archives` (phase 2) |
| `app/core/borg_router.py:434` `BorgRouter.update_stats` | Router entry for the above | Kept as a thin call into the executors, then removed in phase 9 |

### A.2 Existing job machinery

| File | Role | Fate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `app/database/models.py` classes `AgentJob` (125), `RcloneSyncJob` (568), `BackupJob` (608), `RestoreJob` (724), `ScheduledJob` (771), `BackupPlanRun` (1062), `CheckJob` (1173), `RestoreCheckJob` (1210), `CompactJob` (1256), `PruneJob` (1289), `DeleteArchiveJob` (1314), `RepositoryWipeJob` (1345), `PackageInstallJob` (1798) | Per-kind job tables | Migrated per section 13; `AgentJob`, `ScheduledJob`, `BackupPlanRun` remain |
| `app/api/maintenance_jobs.py:50-160` | Shared helpers for check, prune, compact, restore check, delete archive (`ensure_no_running_job`, `create_maintenance_job`, `schedule_background_job`, `start_background_maintenance_job`) | Replaced by `enqueue()` and the runner in phase 5 |
| `app/api/activity.py:312` `list_recent_activity` | Nine per-table queries merged in Python; `ActivityItem` at line 66 | Union with `operations` in phase 1, single query in phase 9 |
| `app/api/activity.py:868`, `:1193`, `:1364` | Logs, log download, delete by `job_type` and `job_id` | Contract kept; resolves `operations` by kind and id from phase 1 |
| `app/services/repository_command_lock.py:37` `run_serialized_repository_command` | Per-repository asyncio lock with `metadata` and `rclone` scopes | Kept; lane rules in 7.2 sit above it |
| `app/utils/process_utils.py` `cleanup_orphaned_jobs`, called from `app/main.py:357` | Startup cleanup per legacy table | Replaced per kind as each migrates; see 7.6 |
| `app/services/job_history_retention.py` | Row and log retention across job tables | Gains `operations` and extension tables (phase 1) |
| `app/main.py:396-460` | Startup of schedulers (stats refresh, MQTT sync, agent job reaper, job history retention) | Runner started here; stats refresh removed |
| `app/api/events.py:18` `EventManager`, `:55` `broadcast_event`, `:136` `/events/stream` | Server-sent events | Gains `operation.updated` and `operation.progress` |
| `app/services/cache_service.py:484` `ArchiveCacheService`, used by `app/api/browse.py` | Redis or in-memory cache of folder listings | Untouched; distinct from the persisted index |
| `app/core/borg.py`, `app/core/borg2.py`, `app/core/borg_router.py:398` and `:731` | Borg wrappers; `list_archive_contents`, `list_archives` | Gain `diff_archives` (phase 2) |
| `app/database/alembic/versions/` | Migrations | New revisions per phase |

### A.3 Frontend surfaces touched

| File | Role today | Fate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `frontend/src/pages/Archives.tsx` (698 lines) | Repository selector, stats grid, list, dialogs, restore wizard wiring | Gains heatmap, search, sync chip; list becomes DB-backed (phase 4) |
| `frontend/src/components/ArchivesList.tsx` (735 lines) | Paginated, grouped, filtered rows; persists `archives-list-*` keys in `localStorage` | Kept behind the list toggle |
| `frontend/src/components/ArchiveCard.tsx` | Row with MAN/SCH chip and four icon buttons | Kept for the list view |
| `frontend/src/components/ArchiveContentsDialog.tsx` and `ArchivePathSelector.tsx` (`getArchiveContents` at `:106`) | Modal folder browser, one request per folder via `frontend/src/services/borgApi/client.ts:154` | Reused inside the Files tab; dialog gains "Open full page" |
| `frontend/src/components/RestoreWizard.tsx`, `MountArchiveDialog.tsx`, `DeleteArchiveDialog.tsx` | Existing archive actions | Reused unchanged by the archive route |
| `frontend/src/pages/Activity.tsx`, `pages/activity/ActivityFilters.tsx`, `components/BackupJobsTable.tsx` | Activity page and table | Gain category and trigger filters and `RunChainRow` (phase 4) |
| `frontend/src/components/RepositoryCard.tsx` | Repository card | Gains the Operations action (phase 4) and the `Last Prune` and `Last Index` metadata entries (10.2) |
| `frontend/src/pages/Settings.tsx` (`tabOrder`, `currentTabId` around `:103-132`) | Settings tab wiring | Gains `background-work` (phase 3) |
| `frontend/src/locales/{en,de,es,it}.json` | Translations | Every new key added to all four |
| `frontend/src/services/api.ts:682` | `/archives/{repo}/{archive}/contents` client | Unchanged; new clients added beside it |
| SSE consumer | No shared hook was found by searching for `EventSource` in `frontend/src`; verify before phase 3 and add `frontend/src/hooks/useOperationEvents.ts` if none exists | Phase 3 |

## Appendix B. Decisions and rejected alternatives

Recorded so later sessions do not re-derive or re-litigate them.

| Decision | Rejected alternative | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Store per-archive change deltas from `borg diff` at backup time | Compute diffs at view time | `borg diff` on demand takes minutes on large archives and needs the lock; stored deltas make diff, history, search, and anomalies a database read |
| Store deltas, not a full per-archive file index | Full listing per archive in SQLite | Tens of millions of rows for a normal install; the delta table gives every feature in scope except instant folder browsing, which stays on Borg plus the existing cache |
| Merge a pruned archive's rows into its successor | Rebuild the index after every prune | Rebuild costs one Borg call per surviving pair on every nightly prune; the merge is one SQL transaction and yields an honest history |
| One generic `operations` table with small extension tables | Keep one table per kind and add a queue table on the side | The twelve tables already share the same core columns; a queue on the side would be a thirteenth shape and Activity would stay nine queries |
| Migrate kinds in phases, backup last, with Activity unioning both worlds | Big-bang migration | Backup has thirty five columns, three creation sites, agents, retry lineage, and plan runs; a phased union keeps every release shippable |
| Category and trigger are separate axes | A "scheduled" category | A scheduled backup and a scheduled check are different work with the same trigger; Activity already models `type` and `triggered_by` separately |
| Background work is a separate tab, not part of Activity | One page with a live section | Activity is a read-only ledger; controls and lane state belong to a live view. Same table underneath |
| Foreground operations appear on the board as the lane holder | Board shows only index work | Without it the board cannot explain why a repository's index work is waiting |
| The board is repository-centric (a card moves across stage columns) | Immich-style per-job-type cards with counts | Per-type counts cannot answer "what is happening to my NAS repo right now" |
| Import stays synchronous through connect only | Fully asynchronous import | A wrong path or passphrase must fail the request; everything after connect is derived data |
| Breadcrumbs plus a details pane in the Files tab | Persistent folder tree on the left | A tree costs one Borg call per expanded node and adds little over breadcrumbs; Miller columns are a possible later toggle |
| Heatmap per series is the default Archives view, list behind a toggle | Keep the paginated list as the only view | The list cannot show gaps or anomalies; existing users keep the list via a persisted preference |
| Restore is non-exclusive | Restore takes the lane | Borg permits concurrent reads; blocking restores behind a backup would be a regression |
| Borg 1 series inferred from plan template prefix, then timestamp stripping, then `default` | Require users to define series | Inference covers the common cases; a manual override is a listed follow-up |
| Managed-agent repositories skip history until the agent gains `diff` | Block the feature on the agent protocol | The rest of the feature ships; the skip is visible and explained |
| Reconcile replaces the hourly stats scheduler rather than running beside it | Keep both | Two writers to the same columns with no coordination is the current bug |
| Codex is not used; all phases are implemented and reviewed by Claude models named in section 13 | Mixed vendors | Owner's decision |
| Hidden rows above the cap collapse to per-subtree summary rows | Drop rows silently or refuse to index | The user sees that truncation happened and where |
| History layer (diff, file history, search, outlier flags) is Pro under one key `archive_history`; browsing, heatmap, and the Background work tab stay Community | Gate everything new, or gate nothing | The insight layer is the value that justifies Pro; the operational layer fixes bugs every user has and must not be withheld |
| Community installs never create history stages, rather than creating and skipping them | Create the operation and mark it skipped with a reason | A permanently skipped column on the board reads as broken, not as locked |
| Phase 1 plan defaults accepted at G1 (2026-09-03): `index_workers` and `background_paused` are `SystemSettings` columns and only `INDEX_ARCHIVE_INFO_PER_RUN` is an env setting; only the Borg 1 server import route changes in phase 1; Activity shows operations rows to any authenticated user, matching legacy rows; `update_repository_stats` stays untouched apart from the import route; running-operation cancel is cooperative through `ctx.cancelled()` with no hard task cancel | The alternatives listed under the plan's Open questions | Owner approved the plan without changes |
| Phase 4 plan defaults accepted at G1 (2026-09-04): `present_in_latest` is derived client-side by comparing a search result's `last_seen_archive_id` with the newest archive id, rather than adding the field to `GET /repositories/{id}/search`; change and file lists reuse the windowing `BackupJobsTable.tsx` already uses instead of adding a virtualisation dependency; `ArchiveContentsDialog`'s "Open full page" action is hidden, not disabled, when the archive has no indexed row; the heatmap requests the route's unbounded default date range with no range control in this phase; the plan was written on Opus 5 although section 13 names Sonnet 5, since 19.5 rates plan writing as cheap on any model | The alternatives listed under the plan's Open questions | Owner approved the plan without changes |
| No subagents in the workflow; each step runs in the session the user opened, on the model the user selected, with the spec telling the user which model the step wants | Orchestrator dispatching subagents with model overrides | Owner's decision on cost; the gates and the progress table give the same control without a second context per step |
| Phase 2 plan defaults accepted at G1 (2026-09-04): the live `borg list` route moves from `GET /repositories/{id}/archives` to `/repositories/{id}/archives/live` (one `api.ts` line changes) so the spec 9.2 path serves the database; modified-file sizes are resolved from the last known size of the path in the series, with no new column, because `borg diff` reports only byte deltas; directories are not stored as change rows, links are stored without sizes; the status strip consults the legacy job tables through `legacy_status.py` until phases 5 to 8 migrate them (deleted in phase 9); `overdue` with no record is true; the spec 14 startup bootstrap is recorded on `SystemSettings.history_bootstrap_at` and runs once per install; `history_index_excludes` is editable through `PUT /repositories/{id}` with the settings UI left to phase 4; fixtures must be real Borg output or Task 3 stops at G4; tasks split Sonnet 5 (1-3, 7-12) and Fable 5.1 (4-6); search is case-insensitive `LIKE` | The alternatives listed under the plan's Open questions | Owner approved the plan without changes |
| The repository status strip (10.2) is withdrawn after phase 3; its `Prune` and `Index` cells move into the card's metadata row, delivered with the repositories list and refreshed from the SSE stream | Keep the strip and batch its route per page; or drop the information with the strip | Two of its six cells restated key stats the card already showed, and a per-card route polled every 30 s cost roughly 15 to 18 queries per repository per refresh (#937). The information itself is wanted per repository, where the operator is; one row in the card's existing format carries it at no extra request, and the status route stays for the dialog |
| Phase 4b redesign (2026-09-05): the per-repository Operations view is a dedicated repository-scoped view with runs grouped by day and follow-ups nested under their parent, reached at `/activity?repository_id=`, not the global Activity table with a pinned filter | Spec 10.5: "It is the same table, not a new component" | Landing on the global ledger with filter chips does not answer "what happened to this repository"; the 10.5 mock shows grouping and nesting the table cannot do |
| Phase 4b redesign (2026-09-05): heatmap orientation and density are the implementer's call; the only requirement is that a year of nightly backups reads as a compact calendar with a visible time axis. Shipped as one shared month axis with a seven-row weekday band per series and 10 px cells | Spec 10.3: "weeks as rows, days as columns" | Weeks as rows makes a year 52 rows tall with 14 px cells; the screenshot showed sparse dots separated by hundreds of pixels of nothing |
| Phase 4b redesign (2026-09-05): the redesign ships in the phase 4 PR, not as a follow-on | The phase 4 branch going to G3 review as-is | The owner wants one merge that leaves the feature finished |
| Phase 4b design accepted in chat (2026-09-05): the Background work board is one row per repository with a four-segment stage track (done, running with elapsed and progress, waiting with the reason, failed with retry) and no stage columns; the foreground backup renders on its repository row; the index worker count is an editable stepper under the History header; the empty state states the last reconcile time (newest `trigger=reconcile` activity row) and offers rebuild inline. The category filter is one `ToggleButtonGroup` shared by Activity and the repository view. The Files tab embeds `ArchivePathSelector` with `variant="embedded"`; restore lives only in the selection footer and in file history; the restore wizard accepts preselected paths and opens on the destination step | Kanban columns with a card per operation; seven `CategoryToken` chips as the filter; separate per-file Restore in the details pane | Owner rejected the phase 3 and 4 output on a real install as unusable; see `docs/engineering/plans/2026-09-05-operations-phase-4b-redesign-brief.md` |
| Per-repository index mode is a three-value mode (`full`, `archives`, `off`), a separate phase (2026-09-06) | A single "exclude from indexing" boolean; folding it into the phase 4 branch | The archive sync is one cheap `borg list` and feeds the heatmap, health, and dashboard age; the history index is the cost users mean by "too large". A boolean forces users to give up the cheap part to escape the expensive one. Kept out of phase 4 so the hub PR merges as reviewed |
| Phase 5 plan defaults accepted at G1 (2026-09-06): the five maintenance services keep their bodies and are handed a `MaintenanceJobFacade` over an `operations` row, so one job-lookup line changes per service instead of a rewrite; job ids resolve to operations first and fall back to pre-phase-5 legacy rows, accepting that an operation id colliding with a historical row of the same kind shadows that row on the by-id routes; maintenance progress writes to the row without an `operation.progress` SSE event, since the board and the legacy routes both poll; the check scheduler counts its scheduled work by filtering `params` in Python rather than adding a column; the dry-run prune and post-backup prune, compact and check run inline through `start_inline_maintenance` plus `finish_inline_maintenance` rather than being queued; no cancel route is added for the four kinds that never had one; and an agent maintenance run now occupies a runner slot for its duration, because `BorgRouter` already waits for the agent and the routes' agent branches are deleted rather than ported | The alternatives listed under the plan's Open questions | Owner approved the plan without changes |
| Phase 6 plan defaults accepted at G1 (2026-09-08): the wipe preview stays in `repository_wipe_jobs` and only the confirmed wipe becomes an operation, with a preview counted as consumed once an operation's `params["preview_id"]` names it, because a preview has no spec 6.3 status and a `queued` row would be dispatched at once; the two wipe statuses the frontend switches on (`completed_compaction_failed`, `failed_partial`) are stored as their nearest spec 6.3 status and reconstructed from `operation_wipe_details.phase`; `package_install` keeps no extension table per spec 6.2, so its stdout and stderr live in the operation log file behind a length-delimited header line the facade parses back for the route contract (sentinel lines at G1, replaced at review), with `exit_code` in `result`; the legacy rclone `triggered_by` word `initial` maps to the spec 6.3 trigger `import`, which no other rclone operation uses; a cache hydrate is an `rclone_sync` operation with `details.operation = "hydrate"`; a wipe is refused while any conflicting kind is `queued`, not only while it is `running`, matching the legacy check's reach over `pending` rows; the mirror scheduler and the initial cloud sync stop spawning their own tasks and enqueue instead, with a resume pass requeueing an interrupted initial sync before `recover_on_startup` would fail it under spec 7.6; and `repository_wipe_service._ensure_no_conflicting_operations`, blind to `operations` since phase 5, is fixed inside this phase rather than as a separate change | The alternatives listed under the plan's Open questions | Owner approved the plan without changes |
| Phase 7 plan defaults accepted at G1 (2026-09-08): `operation_restore_details` carries `original_size` beyond the spec 6.2 list, because `operations.progress_total` is a 32-bit Integer on PostgreSQL and the byte total is the divisor for the percentage and the ETA; `estimated_time_remaining` is derived from the sizes and the speed rather than stored, so a completed restore answers 0; the restore executor takes no repository lock, matching the legacy service; Prometheus restore metrics stay on the legacy table until phase 9, as the phase 5 and 6 kinds' metrics do; an admission refusal on an agent restore stays a failure rather than a spec 7.1 deferral; `archive_name` is written to `params` as well as the details row because `serialize_operation` reads it there; `current_file` is mirrored into `progress_message` for the Background work board | The alternatives listed against each question in the plan's Open questions | Owner's decision at G1; the defaults keep every response body and status word unchanged, per section 13 |
| Numeric job ids stay unqualified while both worlds coexist: an `operations` row wins over a legacy row of the same kind with the same id, on every by-id route (accepted again for phase 6 on 2026-09-08, after a local CodeRabbit pass raised it against the package list, the Activity log routes, and the wipe cancel route) | A source-qualified job key (`operation:<id>` / `legacy:<id>`) threaded through the by-id routes and the frontend | The tradeoff was already accepted for phase 5's five kinds and phase 6 is consistent with it. The collision needs a legacy row and an operation of the same kind to share an id, which on an established install cannot happen (operation ids run thousands ahead of the frozen legacy tables) and is only reachable on an install upgrading straight from pre-phase-1, where `operations` starts at 1. Every outcome is bounded and non-destructive: old history is shadowed on a log route, a duplicate id appears in the package job list (the frontend keys rows on `activity_key`, so rendering is unaffected), and at worst a cancel targets a queued wipe on the same repository instead of a preview, which cancels nothing destructive. The wipe confirm path is already unambiguous: it resolves `preview_id` against `repository_wipe_jobs` directly. A real fix costs three routes plus the frontend and belongs to phase 9, which deletes the legacy tables and removes the ambiguity outright |
| Phase 6 review (2026-09-08): a wipe that ends `failed_partial` enqueues its own follow-up chain (`archive_sync`, `history_merge`, `stats`) from the executor, with the parent's `run_id`, `trigger = followup`, and no dependency on the failed row | Spec 7.4 as written: no follow-ups when the parent fails, leaving the archive list and stats stale until the next reconcile tick | A partial delete is the one failure that changed the repository; the legacy service refreshed stats on every outcome, and the reviewer asked for parity. 7.4 stays the rule for every other kind |
| Phase 8 plan defaults accepted at G1 (2026-09-09): `operation_backup_details` carries `archive_pruned_at` beyond the spec 6.2 list because the legacy column postdates the spec and the routes return it; a parallel `operation_backup_retry_lineage` table with no foreign keys on its three id columns, since `backup_job_retry_lineage` has enforced foreign keys into `backup_jobs`; the callers that ran `execute_backup` inline and continued (multi repository schedule, scheduler post-backup maintenance, plan runner, v2 route) enqueue and wait for the operation, so every backup is dispatched on the lane; a post-backup hook failure after a successful `borg create` still gets the index chain from the executor (phase 6 precedent); post-backup prune, compact and check join the backup's run as children, which nests them under the backup in Activity; the agent start notification's exactly-once guard moves to the `agent_jobs` row because an operation's `started_at` is written at dispatch; route level admission and capacity 409s stay and count backup operations, and the v2 route gains the admission check it lacked; `operations.execution_mode` stores `server` for the legacy word `local`, translated by the facade; Prometheus, MQTT, the dashboard and the backup report read the union rather than waiting for phase 9; crash recovery fails a running agent backup as the legacy sweep did, and a later agent completion overwrites the verdict and enqueues the chain itself | The alternatives listed against each question in the plan's Open questions | Owner's decision at G1; the defaults keep every response body and status word unchanged, per section 13 |
| Phase 9 plan defaults accepted at G1 (2026-09-10): the legacy job rows are copied into `operations` by the collapse revision itself (the section 14 one-off copy) because no release has shipped phases 5 to 8 and the retention window cannot have elapsed for any install; copied rows get new ids with `params["legacy_id"]` keeping the old one and the three link columns rewritten, which is what removes the unqualified id ambiguity; rows whose repository is gone are skipped for the kinds whose `repository_id` is required, and backup or restore rows keep their path in `params["repository"]`; `repository_wipe_jobs` survives as the preview store under its current name with only `previewed` rows; the six facades stay as the attribute surface the services drive and lose only their legacy fallbacks; inline `logs` text becomes an operation log file and a `Logs saved to:` marker resolves to the existing file; `reconcile_orphaned_maintenance_jobs` and the stale scheduled check cleanup are deleted rather than ported, since a queued operation with no agent job is the normal waiting state; `BorgRouter.update_stats` callers enqueue `stats` and `archive_sync`; `borg_backup_orphaned_jobs_total` stays as an empty family; a pre-Alembic transfer lands on `PRE_COLLAPSE_REVISION` (`b8c9d0e1f2a3`) and continues to head so a v2.2.x install keeps its history | The alternatives listed against each question in the plan's Open questions | Owner's decision at G1; the defaults keep every response body and status word unchanged, per section 13, and lose no job history at upgrade, per section 14 |
| Phase 10 plan defaults accepted at G1 (2026-09-11): managed-agent repositories accept `off` as well as `full` and `archives`, because 6.8's condition for refusing it ("until the agent kinds migrate in phase 5") has been met by phases 5 and 9, so 6.8's bullet is corrected rather than implemented; the mode is a side effect of `PUT /repositories/{id}` rather than a route of its own; the manual resync records `trigger = reconcile`, not `manual`, since the trigger names the chain and Activity filters on it; the mode reaches the archive route as a prop from the payloads those pages already hold rather than a hook of its own | A 422 on agent repositories as 6.8 wrote it; a dedicated mode route; `trigger = manual`; a `useIndexMode` hook | The condition 6.8 named is met, so enforcing it would refuse a legal state; the other three each avoided a visible change this phase was not asked to make (Activity's trigger filtering) or a query and test churn the payloads already make unnecessary |
| Phase 10 review (2026-09-11): the `off` card's two last-run entries read "Background work is off for this repository" as plain text with a tooltip pointing at the setting, not as a link | Spec 6.8: the entries link to the setting | The card's metadata row renders plain label/value pairs with tooltips and has no link affordance; adding one to two of its rows would be the only link in the row |
| Phase 10 review (2026-09-11): leaving `full` relinks the queued work that survives onto its nearest surviving dependency before cancelling the rest | Cancel the doomed rows and leave the chain as it falls | A follow-up chain is linear with `stats` last, so cancelling the history stages left `stats` depending on a `cancelled` row, which the runner skips as `dependency_failed`: the size refresh `archives` mode exists to keep would be lost and a failed stage would appear on a repository the user just opted out |
| Phase 10 review (2026-09-11): the catch-up run on returning to `full` forces past the in-flight check | Let it defer to the work already queued, as every other reconcile caller does | The queued work was built for the narrower mode and can never produce the history stages, so deferring meant no catch-up at all until the next tick, which is what 6.8 promises it would avoid |
